On May 8, 1945—V.E. Day—John Hersey won the Pulitzer Prize for his first novel, A Bell for Adano. Twenty years later, with the appearance of his eleventh book, White Lotus, he has been told that while he once aspired to have a silver tongue, he has been given instead a golden touch; that instead of writing literature for all time, he has written books that make the Book-of-the-Month Club.

Among the most recent was one prevailing at Paris that Maximilian I, Emperor elect of Mexico, had recognized the independence of the Confederate States.

The privatization of luxury space in planes, trains and automobiles have certainly enhanced our ability to keep to ourselves on the road (see the rise of personal pods at airports for a recent example of the lengths people will go to for solitude). And as those spaces get increasingly automated, human interaction is becoming increasingly limited (although your mileage may vary as to how much you really enjoy that interaction with customs or gate agents).
Now this is not the way to get a house in order. What this place needs is a real thorough old-fashioned cleaning. A lick and a promise won't do, no, sir!
The first is that of total milieu control — control of all information exchange and imagery in an environment that seeks to extend itself to internal controls of every kind.
This kind of milieu control can be brought about through coercion, Lifton believed, but at its most successful it convinces the subject that he or she is acting spontaneously rather than being directed by values that are alien to the self.

Socially Mack and the boys were beyond the pale. Sam Malloy didn't speak to them as they went by the boiler. They drew into themselves and no one could foresee how they would come out of the cloud. For there are two possible reactions to social ostracism - either a man emerges determined to be better, purer, and kindlier or he goes bad, challenges the world and does even worse things. This last is by far the commonest reaction to stigma.

She is only coming to gloat over my bedraggled and flowerless borders and to sing the praises of her own detestably over-cultivated garden. I’m sick of being told that it’s the envy of the neighbourhood; it’s like everything else that belongs to her—her car, her dinner-parties, even her headaches, they are all superlative; no one else ever had anything like them.

Plucky old Walder Frey gathers his family for a feast and toasts to their massacre of the Stark family. He compliments their bravery in stabbing a pregnant woman and her fetus to death. As every last Frey man swigs their special wine, Walder hypes the cunning it took to invite guests into your home and ambush them. But then things take a turn, the men starting to keel over as Walder seems to admonish them for leaving certain threads hanging. At last the room is empty but for Arya Stark, holding Walder Frey’s face, and a couple girls she leaves alive to spread the legend. “Winter came for House Frey.”

Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen, Jane Fonda and Mary Steenburgen took time out from shooting the 2018 movie Book Club on Monday to take in the eclipse, goofy glasses and all.

They both looked good – I would have been happy with either version. There was no point in making a meal of the decision, so I just picked up the one which was nearest to me on the desk and said, ‘We’ll go with this one.’

Ford's character is a bit one-note, and his gravelly intonation suggests a drunken poet more than a respected newsman, yet he makes a meal of the role all the same, and his pronunciation of the word "frittata" may well be the film's high point.
My dad promised he would take me to a restaurant for dinner today, but much later, he was unexpectedly bitching out.
We should all go inside before somebody keels over from the heat.
We all know that NASCAR came out in support of South Carolina’s decision (and Alabama’s) to remove the Confederate flag from the front of its legislative building. [ … ] But in a classic case of trying to suck and blow at the same time, Daytona Speedway (which is owned by the same people who won NASCAR) will not ban the Confederate flag from its infield at this weekend’s races.
A huge double-fisted fellow hits Marshall a biff on the ear; the General keels over and catches in his fall another gentleman, who hits a fourth, and the party clinging, all fall through a window, and drop through a partly closed cellar-door.
"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day," said Joe. "I don't feel sick." / "Neither do I," said Tom. "I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff Thatcher couldn't." / "Jeff Thatcher! Why he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him try it once. He'd see!"
The enemy had planted a piece of ordinance within gun-shot of the fort during the night, and the first thing in the morning they commenced a brisk cannonade, point-blank, against the spot where I was snoring. I turned out pretty smart, and mounted the rampart. The gun was charged again, a fellow stepped forth to touch her off, but before he could apply the match I let him have it, and he keeled over. A second stepped up, snatched the match from the hand of the dying man, but Thimblerig, who had followed me, handed me his rifle, and the next instant the Mexican was stretched on the earth beside the first.
A staunch old ship she was too, [ … ] There was no hurry in her building. Mynheer Von Dert hewed the logs for her keel, and slept with his fathers. His son Petrus prepared the keelson, then keeled over, and was laid beside his venerable sire.
Plucky old Walder Frey gathers his family for a feast and toasts to their massacre of the Stark family. He compliments their bravery in stabbing a pregnant woman and her fetus to death. As every last Frey man swigs their special wine, Walder hypes the cunning it took to invite guests into your home and ambush them.

If any railway official, policeman, or member of the Forces on duty, requests the discontinuance of any particular form of observation or note-taking, it is clearly right to give immediate compliance, especially when it is borne in mind that public authorities now have very wide powers to hold members of the general public in custody while inquiries are being conducted as to their bona fides.
Were the possibilities of improving the efficiency of British Railways' steam locomotives by making the best use of the reasonably satisfactory low-grade lump coal available today, and thereby saving more high-grade locomotive coal, borne in mind when it was decided to go ahead rapidly with replacement of steam traction?

"Sit down, bo," invited Soup Face. "I guess you're a regular all right. Here, have a snifter?" and he pulled a flask from his side pocket, holding it toward The Oskaloosa Kid. / "Thank you, but;—er—I'm on the wagon, you know," declined the youth.
Gibbons, as Jackson plays him, unflinchingly responds, “A small price I paid for putting foot to ass for my country,” oddly vivid metaphorical language.
[T]hree years later he began formally to go on the wagon: "I quit drinking three months ago, hopefully for life."
In fact regularly going on the wagon is a sure indication of a serious drink problem. If they genuinely enjoy a drink, why would they even want to go a month without one? Obviously because their drinking was causing them a problem.

"Ay, that he shall," replied Fagin, "and we'll have a big-wig, Charley: one that's got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes."
I had meant to speak for ten minutes and must now go on for forty, and, though I've been racking my brains for three hours to think of something, I simply cannot last the course. Now you've got to be a good chap and help me. You're a Free Trader and can tell our people what a wash-out Protection is in the Colonies. All you fellows have the gift of the gab.
He is a political chameleon, as charming to business leaders he met privately in Aberdeen on Friday night as he has been inspiring to distressed and desperate Labour defectors in Glasgow and beyond. The ex-oil economist can do it all because he has the gift of the gab and used to be a leftwing tearaway, expelled from the SNP ranks in stuffier times.

Now for these and other things (whereof I could tell a thousand) was the reckoning come that night; and not a line we missed of it; soon as our bad blood was up. I like not to tell of slaughter, though it might be of wolves and tigers; and that was a night of fire and slaughter, and of very long-harboured revenge. Enough that ere the daylight broke upon that wan March morning, the only Doones still left alive were the Counsellor and Carver.
[I]f we dare not search ourselves close enough to discover the low breeding, the bad blood in us, it will one day come out plain as the smitten brand of the forcat.
"Humph! Thought there was bad blood somewhere!" he exclaimed. . . . "No!" was the determined answer. . . . Because his father was dishonest is no proof that he is a thief."

“Just what are you trying to say here, Miss Parker?” “That you’re a jingoistic idiot.” Yeah, I said the quiet part loud. I blame the pain meds. But there‘s no way I was letting this metal-heavy moron lecture me about my duty to my country, without giving me the chance to make up my own mind.
One's own private knowledge of a man's character is not worth a brass farthing as legal evidence.
Democracy is not worth a brass farthing if it is being installed by bayonets.
My dad is such an armchair quarterback; he recognizes every bad decision the coach makes as soon as the play is over and he knows whether or not it worked.
I told the staff...the day before the hurricane struck that I expected them to cut every piece of red tape, do everything they could, that it was balls to the wall, that I didn't want to hear anybody say that we couldn't do anything—to do everything they humanly could to respond.
Produced by none other than Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Good Boys again most closely resembles a kind of junior-varsity tryout for that duo's Superbad, down to its modestly affecting emotional through-line: an acceptance of the fact that childhood friendships, forged out of proximity and convenience, aren't always destined to last.

Why don't we take a leaf out of the government's book and have a think tank?
He found that at the “take-off point,” every one of them began engaging in what he called “blue-sky thinking.” In blue-sky thinking, you imagine that all things are possible for you, just like looking up into a clear blue sky with no limits.
Much work in future scenario planning has relied on the astute few to undertake blue-sky thinking, usually in committees, and so ‘futures thinking’ presents only a partial view of what tomorrow's society might look like and how this impacts on the future workings of the industry.
If the stakeholders say they want “blue-sky thinking,” you can use carefully selected exploratory concepts to test your blue-sky ideas and watch their reactions.
[ … ] your sneers against Doctor Hardy are lies! He doesn’t put on frills, or have an office in a fashionable location, or drive around in an expensive automobile.
The metaphorical blue-sky thinking recommended by startup accelerators in Silicon Valley is no substitute for the blue sky itself, which will go on shining whether we are here to look at it or not.

… the line crossed over an iron bridge spanning Ludgate Hill itself … neatly obliterating any view of St Paul's from Ludgate Circus and Fleet Street.

A narrative circulates at Mitchell, Hall about a naive young employee who, in his eagerness to be creative, "reinvents the wheel," devoting so many hours reformulating work that has already been done that he drives himself into a nervous breakdown.
[ … ] I do not want to make inflated claims for the methodological or conceptual novelty of a certain school or group of writers. Claims to historiographical significance set in a methodological key too often turn out to be claims to have reinvented the wheel. On the contrary, what follows is intended merely to provide some account of the current state of historiographical play in the interpretative aftermath of what has come to be called revisionism and to use the figure of Wentworth to do so.
Polls show three-quarters of the people don't want us to invade Haiti. Nonetheless, it appears we're about to go knee-deep in the Big Muddy.
Evidently, the trend in security applications is to reinvent the wheel, or in this case, to reinvent the directory service.
Overprocessing. The big problem in this area is a lack of standardization. A lot of time is spent reinventing the wheel. There are a lot of similar activities, and the lead time (set-up time) for reinventing the process should be eliminated.
But although AFI (The Blood Album) doesn't reinvent the wheel, it doesn’t need to: The record illustrates that the members of AFI are deeply committed to forward motion, and remain as fired up now as they were 25 years ago.

"The originality of the plan and views of the author [Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent], and, above all, the perfect independence of its execution," are, according to the narrator in the Bulletin, the chief features of this new production; and the summary sketch of it which has been published, is (to use the phraseology of the same writer) "as a kind of trial balloon," launched with the view of seeing how the wind sits for his "great work."
Publishers frequently used subscription announcements as trial balloons. If they failed to elicit much response, they would drop the project, having lost only a pittance for the publication of the prospectus or having gained a ransom from some competitor who took them seriously.

There is no shortage of examples in which EC competition law and European social law have been at loggerheads while trying to draw a line in the sand separating their respective territories.
Even so, the current crisis might well have been defused weeks ago, before the two leaders started exchanging threats of war, had the United States agreed to talk directly to North Korea, as our allies in the region have been pleading with us to do.

We suggest that your committee assume the responsibility for establishing a definite long range construction program for the American Merchant Marine. This is a tall order but one of extreme urgency. An entire indusry is now suspended in the balance between war and peace, and upon you and your committee depends which way the scales will tip.
These are tall orders, but they are, in part, the responsibilities you assumed when you donned the mantle of manager.

The first subcategory is what I choose to call Fat Fingers Syndrome. This is a problem obviously caused by poor typing techniques which result in a single finger striking two keys instead of one. … The opposite of the fat finger problem is what I call simply the Missed Key(s). This can also result in the writing of real (but wrong) words, such as "rod" for rode or "trace" for trance.
Maximum quantity limits help prevent human and algorithmic "fat finger" errors by enforcing the maximum order sizes and trading positions.
Still, due to fat fingers, user-interface elements need to be large enough and spaced far apart enough so that users' fingers can find their way around the interface comfortably.

Now that word-processing has caught on, typewriters have gone the way of the dodo.
It is long since that disorderly potentate [the Lord of Misrule] went the way of the Dodo, and hippocras has become almost as mythical as ambrosia; but, once upon a time, they played a prominent part in legal education.
[W]e confess that we should feel a lively satisfaction if we could see the sailor who set his dog at the helpless mass of ovine misery [sheep transported by ship across the English Channel] properly tied down in a conspicuous place on the deck of his ship, stripped to his waist, and then treated to such an allowance of the cat-of-nine-tails (if that animal has not gone the way of the dodo and the great auk) as would make him hate the taste of mutton for the rest of his natural life.
George and John Rennie, and James Ekron, a servant of my father’s, announced their determination to march in and beard the lion in his den, provided three of the Mulattoes, who were superior marksmen, would support them.

[H]istorians have turned from the past to the future, concerned with what will happen to their professional calling in the decades and centuries to come, fearful that in this age of instant communication and gratification, when an era as recent as the sixties can seem to our students as remote as the Wars of the Roses was to us in our college days, that history is going the way of the dodo.
The football team walked away with a 1-0 victory.
For most of the world, the LP has unfortunately gone the way of the dodo. But although LPs are far from the public eye, they've never really gone away.
If you imagine, then, that the travelling journeyman is simply an anachronism – and went the way of the Dodo, or the Luddites – there would, admittedly, be more than a grain of truth in your reaction. But you would be only partly right.
I must cross swords with the author of the article on the Mountain Railways of the Bernese Oberland, on two points.

To mention Bishop Manning's name in a city room is equivalent to telling the city editor that a rip-roaring good story is brewing.

"Constant readers" of the Times [ … ] must have been often amused by watching the change which yearly comes over the great journal during the months of autumn. When Parliament is no longer sitting and the gay world is no longer gathered together in London, something very different is supposed to do for the remnant of the public from what is needed in the politer portions of the year. [ … ] In the dead of autumn, when the second and third rate hands are on, we sink from nonsense written with a purpose to nonsense written because the writer must write either nonsense or nothing.

Mohandas Lakesh Singh's thoughts were far away when Donald Bry placed the report on his desk. Lakesh responded with a jump of sudden surprise. “I'm sorry,” Bry apologized. “I didn't realize you were—” “Think nothing of it, Donald,” Lakesh assured with a dismissive wave of his hand. “I was just...away with the fairies.”

"Bob, they've got the goods on you. There's a warrant out."
And the film shows how mother-care can be more convincing than a legal brief in getting the goods on the corporate villains.
[T]hey are either round-shouldered, knock-kneed, bow-legged, or parrot-toed; some are also badly cross-eyed. It seems as if they can see two different ways at the same time. Jack says they are lop-sided and out of kilter altogether.

“Deladrieux should have stayed an accountant,” Murphy sighed. “He's got three people working for him but they're just administrative clerks, pencil-pushers, they couldn't organise a piss-up in a brewery. That's what you get when you assign engineering jobs to non-engineers.[ … ]”
Snowstorms often knock the Government's Salt Lake radio range out of kilter.
This was a champion team out of kilter, stung by what was arguably an act of disrespect to their opponents, a failure to appreciate their threat and the fine planning of Carlos Osorio, and never really able to regain its balance.

She set the bar at an hour of exercise a day.
When she wrote, asking me to take charge of her house while she went to Europe, I gladly consented, sight unseen.
The tests give the market the chance to kick the tyres of some of Europe's weaker financial institutions, so you might expect the City to be enthusiastic about them.

Many people remained in their hiding places until the war was well and truly over.

Golf is supposed to be a gentleman's game, but I curse everyone and his mother out there. I have to win.
The boss wants some new ideas—it's time to think outside the box.
"THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX". If you have kept your thinking process operating inside the lines and boxes, then you are normal and average, for that is the way your thinking has been programmed. ... Here are nine dots: If you were asked to pick up a pencil and try to touch every dot using four straight lines only, you would try it this way first. It would be incorrect. That's because this configuration is in the shape of a box and we are conditioned to think this way.

He was a regular "Miller of Dee," caring for nobody; and yet he was likeable, that humorous old stoic, who suffered from gall-stone, and bore horrible bouts of pain like a hero.
It is sufficient that the former provided the setting for implanting in the minds of the jury the notion that Sinhel had engaged in other related crimes and making that notion explicit with regard to the defendant by the "tip of the iceberg" argument. In short, the prosecutor insinuated Sinhel had been given many gifts and gratuities for an illegal purpose, probably from the defendant, beyond those for which the defendant was charged and beyond those for which proof was offered at the trial. The prejudice of a defendant of inviting conviction on facts—if they be such—dehors the record is counter to the basic concept of fairness.
The exposed tip of the iceberg, the recognized illness that brings a man to his doctor, is relatively small compared with the hidden mass of undetected disease, or 'at risk' people, in the population.

The blacking out of the lights of the nation's biggest city could be a blessing in disguise. It brought to light, dramatically, the deep unrest in a large part of the Black and Latin population and it emphasized the fact that something must be done and soon to quiet that unrest.

Records document nineteen legal cases involving the charge of sodomy and five executions from 1607 to 1740, although this is no doubt just the tip of the iceberg of actual incidents.

Banbury story of a cock and a bull. A roundabout nonſenſical ſtory.]

Now, if you look at the chart of a stock that has suffered a collapse, you will see that at the bottom of each drop there is a small uptick, a rise in the price. This uptick, representing the smart money getting out because it knows what is coming, and fools getting in because they don't, is known as the dead cat bounce, so-called because if you drop a dead cat off a skyscraper the cat will bounce, too, but the movement doesn't mean the cat is alive.
“Fitz,” Assistant Director Roy McKinnon said the day he summoned me to his office at headquarters in Washington in late 1980, “we need an Irishman to go to Boston to kick ass and take names.”
There's this thing called the Dead Cat Bounce. It's a stock market term, I believe. What it's talking about is the fact that even a stock that is essentially worthless and really going nowhere but down for ever can register a slight upward movement, just for a bit, because there is generally a floor for almost everything. The comparison rests on the fact that even when a cat hits the pavement from forty stories high and dies instantly, it'll still bounce back up a little.

He had to put down a deposit of sixty grand to secure the theatre and just as he was about to sign the cheque, American Equity moved the goalposts yet again.
When a practice harmfully moves the goalposts, but does not violate freedom to trade, the ban on "unfair methods of competition" in Section 5 of the FTC Act might be a better fit than the ban on restraints of trade in the Sherman Act.
The polio vaccination program took a body blow last spring when the disease developed in children injected with vaccine from the Cutter Laboratories of Berkeley, Calif.
I was not able to learn what particular ceremony was observed in forming the marriage contract, but am inclined to think that it must have been of a very simple nature. Perhaps the mere "popping the question", as it is termed with us, might have been followed by an immediate nuptial alliance.
[A]t a pic-nic to Kenilworth, where we drank a good deal of champagne, I actually popped the question, and was accepted. In another month, Robert Stubbs, Esq., led to the altar, Leah, widow of the late Z. Manasseh, Esq., of St. Kitt's!
He called him everything he could think of, and this was a great deal, for Sammy has a wicked tongue.

70% of men welcome the idea of women's proposing marriage; 48% of women say they'd be willing to pop the question.
There was a terrible "whipping of the cat, " as it is called, on the day the notes became due. This whipping the cat is nothing more than a parcel of traders puffing at one another's heels . . . to borrow money.
I believe one of the members of our hunting section was lucky enough to get a subscription through before they stopped it. The rest of the members of the section have been "whipping the cat” because they left it too late
Whipping the cat may only increase our resentment and burn us up with anger. We may engage in combat with our neighbor until both are exhauste . Calling a truce and limping back under our own roof would not be peace.
In the end, meeting a mutual impasse, they adopt a policy of "whip the cat. " The farm labourer gets blamed for whatever goes wrong i.e. for everything.

Indeed, one of the problems of deviant communities in San Francisco is coping with the periodic influx of a new generation of bohemians who have heard that it is the place to be: the beatnik migration of the late fifties and the hippie hordes of 1967.

Keep an eye peeled, you never know when the ice-cream truck will pass by.
No doubt the new form of drive will have its teething troubles and this may be expected; but even if each ship manages to unload one cargo where it is badly needed and then it is beached, mechanical troubles will be comparatively unimportant provided all the crew are safe.
Ms. Leopold . . . said today that she saw the attack, for which she received more than 50 stitches, as more of a bump in the road than a serious deterrence to her goal.
"We're such a small bump in the road that driving through Sylvester is like hitting an armadillo at 60 miles an hour," drawls local businessman David Register.
He admitted that in their early days these units suffered a number of teething troubles, which, he said, "one may now look back upon with some wonder", as their causes were not hard to find.
He was on his way to Cleveland, Ohio to visit the steelworks there, review their working practices and sort out any problems. He knew there would be some, they had recently installed a new casting system that he had helped to develop, and the plant back home had experienced some teething troubles.

In place of dividing the merit of the discovery between the Englishman and the Scotchman, and giving the lion's share to my countryman, I have given the whole merit of the discovery to [Henry] Cavendish the Englishman, and have reserved only for [James] Watt the Scotchman, the merit of the previous hypothesis,—a merit freely given him by Cavendish himself, and one which no other person ever claimed.
But England suffered great damage, and was put to very heavy expense in compelling restitution. She voluntarily surrendered all claim to the lion's share of the prize, though she certainly did the lion's share of the work, and bore the lion's share of the expense.
The real cause of poverty in Europe is the great wealth of the few. The masses always be poor when a few kings and nobles hoard such enormous lion's shares.
You would have the lion's share of everything. Now for myself I intend to have the lion's share. And why shouldn't I? Isn't it about time some woman had it? You can't have the lion's share if you are not free. I mean to be free. If I marry I shall want a husband that is not a prison …
In fact, at the end of some of the Con Game sessions, some subjects suggested playing for money. We must add, however, that it was usually those who had collected the lion's shares of the points who made such suggestions.
Yet it could have been so different for Tony Pulis's side, who weathered a good start by the hosts to create the lion's share of what few first-half chances came along.
I don't really believe all that – I was just playing devil's advocate.
Now, play devil's advocate. Can't you live 20 years on $145,000 if you're living out of a motor home and just eating and painting and writing books? I mean, this is what we talked about when we were 19. Remember, we kept saying, "Let's find ourselves," but we didn't have a dollar! So, we watched television instead.
I'm as friendly as the next girl.
I was saying to my Albert, I wouldn't be surprised if him and that so-called wife of his was living over the brush.
He was on cloud nine for days after she agreed to marry him.
In your zeal you may not feel you are undertaking a thing for your own sake but think you are doing so for God. Nevertheless, you should remember that at the time of great excitement as though you were on cloud nine, you may perhaps be most fleshly!
Following a highly successful tour of Italy in July/August 1993, with recital and orchestral appearances and an especially inspiring last performance, I returned to New York on cloud nine and full of euphoria.
A. A. scanned the crowd and spotted Lili's happy face. Lili had been on cloud nine ever since she and Max had gotten back together.
On the first day at the university I was on cloud nine that I had begun my intellectual life. I was happy to join the cream of creams.
Now, the system approach, needless to say, wants to help out in that particular problem, but it lives up on cloud nine for the most part. This is one of the reasons that it has not made more headway than it has in the civilian agencies of government.

Mr. Walsh – [ … ] It sounds like the purpose of the geographic base coding system is to fulfill a planning function of the agency. If that is not the case, then I am concerned as that is one way to get up on "cloud nine"—that is, to not associate with end products.
Members are living on cloud nine if they think that playing the stock-numbers game is doing anything for the farmers or the country.
By coming to grips with these problems, we can demonstrate that libertarianism is not just a beautiful ideal somewhere on Cloud Nine, but a tough-minded body of truths that enables us to take our stand and to cope with the whole host of issues of our day.
Climbing so close to an erupting volcano was tickling the dragon's tail.
But, there is no previously unseen "far side" of Mars. It shows us all of itself.¶ On the other hand, the crew of the Kilroy would probably be able to see the back of the moon after the got past its orbit on their way to Mars.¶ On the gripping hand, by the time there was a flight to Mars, one would expect that flights past the moon had previously occurred.
Louise had two new books, one black, one red. Apparently they were about the occult. On the one hand, we needed to know what we were dealing with. On the other, I didn't think that it was the sort of thing we should be getting involved with ourselves. On the gripping hand we didn't have to use it ourselves, so that was alright.
The anonymous oracle, the author of this pamphlet, is an example of entertaining dullness. He has manufactured a very damp squib; he is a serious man in motley; and practical ideas occasionally drop in among his fantastic vaticinations.
Arsène Wenger confessed: "The result was not an accurate indication of the match." Certainly, at half-time it seemed unlikely that Arsenal would catch fire so spectacularly because the first half was a damp squib of a display from Wenger's team, as Newcastle initially showed no ill-effects from their Old Trafford ordeal.
That whole campaign was a damp squib, they cranked it up as a real possibility that Scotland might win, and when we actually got there it didn't happen like that, and everybody came home quite early with their tails between their legs.
Some of the stadiums being built for the World Cup soccer tournament, scheduled for next year, have also been criticized for delays and cost overruns, and have become subjects of derision as protesters question whether they will become white elephants.
To the extent the box keeps the outside world away — then, yes, it is better to think inside the box.
We like to think of ourselves as walking face forward into the future, eyes on the prize.
Clinton must weigh up the excitement of a rule-breaking all-female ticket against the cold, hard political calculation of how best to win the presidential race. She's a realist who has her eyes on the prize, and winning the White House will likely trump all other considerations.
He took no notice of the spider until it bit him.
There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery. Sometimes she took no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes, for no reason whatever, she went swooping about like a great wind and hustled them away in cupboards.
In 2009, he underwent heart surgery for an aortic valve replacement at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, an event that Mr. Williams said caused him to take stock of his life.
At the outset of any inquiry it is proper to take stock of the results obtained by previous explorers of the same field.
He never felt quite clean with “cat baths”—as Marcel called them, or “a lick and a promise,” the way Renaud put it.
Workers scrambled to slap it all together on nothing but a lick and a promise—unlike the pristine whiteness of the court, the haphazard shacks ahead clashed in color and stripe, some tall, some short, each roof at an awkward angle to the other.

Clearly superior to her opposition, Lady Val got the upper hand late and won going away. What a ride!
The milieu control exerted over the broader social environment of Communist China, while considerably less intense, is in its own way unrivalled in its combination of extensiveness and depth; it is, in fact, one of the distinguishing features of Chinese Communist practice.
Milieu Control involves the control of daily schedule including food intake, sleep, information and time and space for critical reflection.
"Who says he did?" / "Aubry." / "Yeah? A guy in for murder? Come again." / "Glad to. Beebe says so too."
A second way in which milieu control is affects group members is linked to groups' conscious efforts in that regard. That is, the groups maintain milieu control especially by way of labeling recalcitrant members as 'subjective' or 'objective agent.' The former term is used for those who are thought to have harmed the organization by their mistakes or failures in groups' operations.

I would be being economical with the truth if I were to tell you that I was enjoying myself.
A senior British civil servant, arguing that the book ‘Spycatcher’ should not be published, let slip how ‘being economical with the truth’ is an option in matters of government policy. The phrase became a headline in Australia, highlighting, as much as anything, British duplicity. In fact, it originated with Edmund Burke, the eighteenth century statesman and constitutional theorist. [ … ] In effect, the idea of ‘being economical with the truth’ underlines the challenge any manager or public servant faces – that unguarded, inappropriate, or even appropriate comment can lead to damaging and undesirable reactions.
So, I am now asking you, was he economical with the truth? Bearing in mind you are now telling us that there were heaps of telephone conversations, things that you described elsewhere as “lovely” conversations, “nice” conversations, “interesting” conversations and that when politicians ring you, you take notice.
There was one overriding technique used by both sides to dupe the public, and it was the deliberate omission of key information about any demoralising incident, operation or battle, such as facts about their own or even the enemy's losses. [ … ] This approach can probably be best described as ‘being economical with the truth’ – a phrase whose literal meaning has rather been lost over the years, as it has rather erroneously come to signify telling outright lies.
I have supported with very great zeal, and I am told with some degree of success, those opinions, or if his Grace likes another expression better, those old prejudices, which buoy up the ponderous mass of his nobility, wealth, and title.
You must have had the patience of a saint to sit through that awful film!
The desk-killer operates from within a network of other faceless functionaries radiating in every direction and in which the sense of responsibility could be passed along from faceless bureaucrat to faceless bureaucrat with the greatest of ease, as if it is nothing but an item passed along a conveyor belt on a mass-production line.

As I listened to the tapes over months of Sundays, it became clear that I would not work with [John] Lilly. I was more interested in the dolphins speaking to dolphins than in the attempts to teach them our language.
“Fleet Foxes” meandered and gathered rosebuds and killed time, but it also announced the arrival of a significant young songwriter.
Over the years, she'd visited the McIntoshes and also her daughters in Sydney but she had never, in a month of Sundays, dreamed she would live there herself.
I [Tennessee Williams] told her [Eva Le Gallienne] I had, indeed, read the plays of Mr. [Henrik] Ibsen, had seen them in numerous productions, and found them to be quite like the act of eating a box of soap flakes, when they were not like two months of Sundays in church.
"[T]he congressional committees aren't gonna belly up to the bar and say, 'We authorized this,'" says Scheuer.

Washington reporters . . . were seen by the president's people as on the wrong side of history—both technologically and politically.
At a time when other entertainment is available at a sliver of the price from Netflix and other streaming services, live sport is the only thing left to induce viewers to pay through the nose for pay-TV.

The Post Office bitterly resents the criticism that is constantly voiced in the British press, both by "Disgusteds of Tunbridge Wells" and journalists.

If you only say the word, we shall take the gilt off the gingerbread,—you guess what I mean,—but remember that Sir Robert Walpole said, ‘every man has his price.’
A seedy kind of men come to me that can't get credit with regular first houses, and though I get very good prices out of 'em all, I've made some losses in particular directions, that quite took the gilt off the gingerbread.
According to the writer, Monks Farm bore a sinister local reputation, and was about as thoroughly haunted as any place could be, and in order to justify his thesis, he gave an account of its history. … The discussion that followed the reading of the paper, and which was recorded in all its wordy fullness, somewhat took the gilt off the gingerbread, however, for it was pointed out by persons familiar with local customs as well as local superstitions, that the empty buildings of Monks Farm had long been a favourite haunt of lovers without benefit of clergy.

Compressed and concentrated, confined to a single sharp pang or two, but none the less in wait for him there on the Euston platform and lifting its head as that of a snake in the garden, was the disconcerting sense that "respect," in their game, seemed somehow—he scarce knew what to call it—a fifth wheel to the coach.]

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has categorically ruled out any new negotiations saying the future of the Falklands can only be decided by the islanders themselves in accordance with the UN principle of self-determination.

I don't think he's all there...
That little girl we'd practically adopted made me walk on sunshine. There could be no option where she wasn't doing great. I wouldn't be able to handle it.
I think he's not all there...
A suspicion that “he was not all there,” and therefore “one of God’s bairns,” had insured him, during his long orphanage, the food, and clothes, and shelter, necessary for life; but no one had given him love.
This was a big speech with a high degree of difficulty. And, Don Jr. stuck the landing.
His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.
[S]he smiled at me in a such a silly way, I thought to wonder if she was all there.
The captain used to to run the rule over every new recruit, like a protective father inspecting the boy his darling daughter had brought home to tea. He was obsessive about it.

In a letter to Mr. Watt this week, Mr. Quitberg suggested that the Secetary had been shooting from the lip again. "You have never met me and until that moment had undoubtedly never heard of me," he wrote.

His mother is having an affair with the man next door, is reading Germain Greer's The Female Eunuch—which spawns Adrian's first wet dream.
Bruce Springsteen may become middle America's wet dream.
The plan is, if all goes well, to have these batteries, an eco warrior's wet dream due to their non-toxicity, on sale in two or three years.
At that time we had a treaty with about every foreign country except Belgium, and that banana republic, Anchuria.
The banana workers of this former banana republic were exceptionally well organized and effective in their demands from the very beginning of the revolution.
Now there's a golden oldie, a blast from the past, when the heavyweight division was still strong and vibrant and unified (...)
In the process, he managed to make the Republican tax cut sound like a blast from the past.

Puel was let go in June despite leading Southampton to their first major final for 14 years and an eighth-place finish in the Premier League. But apparently his style was too boring and some players and many fans disliked his method, so he had to go – fair enough but look at them now.
The dog was eyeing up my steak.
He missed much of his senior year, drifted, but finally graduated. He hasn't gone to college and realizes now that he wants that experience. [ … ] Some of these stories have happy landings.
After all, they never come home for Christmas.

They won't be coming home for Christmas after all.
Then the idea returned to her that, after all, her son might not be innocent in the Ellen matter—and this was so interesting that she felt bound to get as near the truth as she could.
It seems to me that "grass seed capital of the world" is a fairly shaky claim to fame.
She broke up with her boyfriend last week.
The meeting finally broke up after a three-hour discussion.
At length, one night, when the company by ſome accident broke up much ſooner than ordinary, ſo that the candles were not half burnt out, ſhe was not able to reſiſt the temptation, but reſolved to have them ſome way or other. Accordingly, as ſoon as the hurry was over, and the ſervants, as ſhe thought, all gone to ſleep, ſhe ſtole out of her bed, and went down ſtairs, naked to her ſhift as ſhe was, with a deſign to ſteal them [ … ]

Well, during our short staycation at Humberston Fitties, just south of Cleethorpes, we cycled through the very unspoilt Lincolnshire Wolds, which are by no means flat and boring as conventional wisdom about the county suggests.

"And you hit him? dear old Father Bhaer?" [ … ] "I was hopping mad at the time, and thought I shouldn't mind a bit, rather like it perhaps. But when I'd hit uncle one good crack [ … ] I couldn't go on. [ … ] I felt so mean."
Dora wouldn't help me make pies, cause she was afraid of messing her clo'es and that made me hopping mad.
The biggest press news in Washington last week was that the "White House gang" — the little group of reporters whose beat is covering the President — was hopping mad at Franklin Roosevelt. Most of them felt that the President had played them for suckers and they were no happier when other newsmen rubbed it in.
Rhonda L. Gaynier, a New York lawyer, is hopping mad because, she says, getting on an airplane these days means being groped by a stranger.
His tastes in music run the gamut from classical to heavy metal.
Palestinians often feel that the police do very little to stop settler violence, which runs the gamut from physical assault, arson, cutting or burning down olive trees, stone throwing at random Palestinian cars, and property damage.
They stayed together during three dances, went out on to the terrace, explored wherever they were permitted to explore, paid two visits to the buffet, and enjoyed themselves much in the same way as if they had been school-children surreptitiously breaking loose from an assembly of grown-ups. The boy became volubly friendly and bubbling over with unexpected humour and high spirits.
The arcaders have it easy. All they need to do is drop a quarter into a machine to find out how good the latest shoot 'em up game really is. But for the home computer owner, it's another story.

To try to imagine what the country would have looked like without the dominant politician of the past 60 years is a dizzying exercise. Margaret Thatcher made the weather.
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot to tell you, there's a missing step on the unlit staircase with no railings. But it's okay because we all just remember to jump over it." Some people are like that missing stair.
This diversion was enjoyed on the sly, and unknown to the ladies of the house.
Finance is seldom romantic. But the idea of peer-to-peer lending comes close. This is an industry that brings together individual savers and lenders on online platforms.[ … ]Banks and credit-card firms are kept out of the picture. Talk to enough people in the field and someone is bound to mention the “democratisation of finance”.

I have not visited them of late, but I hear they are doing well.
It is total "Victory at Sea" out there today- 17 to 25 knot onshore winds kicking up big. messy windswell/chop everywhere.
It is extremely fast and comfortable to ride in 2 foot chop like we had in the ocean today. It will still run near 60 in that "victory at sea" if one can hang on.
A diminishing swell Saturday led officials to call for a lay day, then a strong on-shore storm system moved through overnight leaving victory at sea conditions yesterday.
It's not Maui, but wind swell becoming Victory At Sea conditions on the outside as it goes 4.2.
HIGH SURF AND DANGEROUS RIP CURRENTS CONTINUE TODAY WITH VICTORY AT SEA CONDITIONS. SOME BEACH EROSION HAS LIKELY OCCURRED OVER IN THE PANHANDLE.
Che [Guevera] jumped from his seat and rushed from the room, pursued by the entire press corps. Down the hall he went, and into the men's room where, surrounded by reporters, he proceeded to answer the call of nature, shouting: "Liberdad!"

Mrs Willy Nilly full of tea to her double-chinned brim broods and bubbles over her coven of kettles on the hissing hot range always ready to steam open the mail.
She made her innocent bow, and retired without a suspicion that she had been an embarrassment. Nothing would have happened, now, perhaps, if quiet could have been maintained for a few minutes, so that the people could get a grip upon themselves, but the strain overpowered my old maid partner and she exploded like a bomb; a general and unrestrained crash of laughter followed, of course, the happy tears flowed like brooks, and no one was sorry of the opportunity to laugh himself out and get the blessed relief that comes of that privilege in such circumstances.
When I reached this stage of visual chaos I stopped for a moment to get a grip on myself. It would not do to let my nerves get the better of me at the very outset of what would surely be a trying experience, […]

We broke away toward the north, the tribe howling on our track. Across the open spaces we gained, and in the brush they caught up with us, and more than once it was nip and tuck.

They call for the economics syllabus to be rewritten to reflect the chasm between the confident mechanistic models they are still taught and the real economy which went pear-shaped.

Plausibility, I know, can only be unmasked by shewing the absurdities it glosses over, and the simple truths it involves with specious errors.
This book only glosses over quantum mechanics, and doesn't go into detail.

This evening, at a thinly attended meeting of the parliamentary party, Jim Sheridan demanded to know why ministers were interfering in the strike by the BA cabin crew – both Andrew Adonis and Gordon [Brown] denounced the strikers over the weekend. 'How have we got ourselves into this situation?' asked Ken Purchase, pointing out that there had been two ballots, the last of which came out 80 per cent in favour of strike action. 'We should either be keeping shtum or back the workers.'
In the other century, and for a considerable number of years in this one, the solid citizenry of the town prided itself on home ownership …. One got a little place, planted a couple of fruit trees and a currant bush out back, made garden, seeded a lawn, and put a standing lamp on a center table in the living room.
And I would plead that the situation is not unusual. It's just one of those things you're supposed to keep shtum about.
Reggie is another one who keeps shtum about things. But one Christmas, when I was over here and called in to wish them seasonal good cheer, we had a few whiskies and he got loquacious.

For months, Dati warned she would refuse to stand aside. Now she has stunned the political class with an open letter to Fillon in Le Monde, a scathing character assassination accusing him of the "lone ambition" of a disillusioned political elite, of doing politics in a way that "never favoured women" and stopping ethnic-minority candidates from progressing at elections. She said he was committing "a sad mistake" in trying to run in Paris.

To put it in the social jargon, I was merely not at home to Slatter. A loud and prolonged ringing of the door-bell proclaimed that he had found the right number.
A man, remember, whether rich or poor, should do something in this world. No one can find happiness without work. Woe betide the lazy fellow! Laziness is a serious illness and one must cure it immediately; yes, even from early childhood.
And woe betide the peasant who protested! He would be lucky to escape with a few blows across the face from his lord's riding whip, for a noble landowner was also his peasant's judge and could punish him as he pleased.
Although they aspired, like all natural-born gamblers, to taking a flutter and beating that system (they all loved the idea of tips, of course), they were sufficiently cynical to know it's a mug's game and that it was largely bound to fail.

In America alone, people spent $170 billion on “direct marketing”—junk mail of both the physical and electronic varieties—last year. Yet of those who received unsolicited adverts through the post, only 3% bought anything as a result. If the bumf arrived electronically, the take-up rate was 0.1%. And for online adverts the “conversion” into sales was a minuscule 0.01%. That means about $165 billion was spent not on drumming up business, but on annoying people, creating landfill and cluttering spam filters.

Organisational capitital is typically described as dead. It is what has been left behind after human capital has left the building.
When a Risk Taker gets a hold of an idea, reason has left the building. And with it go concern for other people's feelings, attention to details, and longrange planning.
The reason why they’re so interested in what we have here is fuel-cell experts don’t grow on trees and it’s relatively high-level expertise you need.

The band were banging out a vaguely recognisable version of the Star Spangled Banner.
They bang out bubblegum punk that couldn't be more reductive if Joey Ramone himself were hovering over their shoulders with his Gabba Gabba Hey! sign.

The episode also opens with an inspired bit of business for Homer, who blithely refuses to acquiesce to an elderly neighbor’s utterly reasonable request that he help make the process of selling her house easier by wearing pants when he gallivants about in front of windows, throw out his impressive collection of rotting Jack-O-Lanterns from previous Halloweens and take out his garbage, as it’s attracting wildlife (cue moose and Northern Exposure theme song).

His electoral "campaign" to date has included attempts to trump up criminal charges against his opponents.

It seems like everyone always tries to point the finger at somebody else.
That is a serious accusation, so make sure you have plenty of evidence before you point the finger at someone.
In terms of comparing rail with other transport modes, Dr Laurie Wright, senior lecturer at Solent University, tells RAIL: "It is easy to point the finger at aviation and view rail as a low-carbon alternative. … You go somewhere, you burn fuel to get there, and people point fingers at you for it.

Every time I ask him to do something for me, it falls on deaf ears.
My earlier warnings, both in RAIL and in an article I wrote for The Times, have not fallen on deaf ears.

It's because you let people get away with murder, Quill.
He said I found out about everything he did and said, 'I can't get away with nothing, and Jim can get away with murder.' I don't think that I let any of my kids get away with murder, and I don't think any one of them ever did much serious mischief.

She's been seeing William now for about seven months and it looks as if they may take the plunge.
I was pretty much going to be the last one among my peers to take the plunge. That meant I had previously heard their unique engagement stories.
She shrugged. "I don't know. I guess I'm thinking who am I to tell my mother she shouldn't marry." “Especially since you're about to take the plunge yourself?” he asked lightly. She opened her mouth to tell him the truth, but the interest in his expression frightened her.

I was about to say that I had known the Celebrity from the time he wore kilts. But I see I will have to amend that, because he was not a celebrity then, nor, indeed, did he achieve fame until some time after I left New York for the West.
the rather casual remark of Lord Thomson, referring to his holding in Scottish Television, that the television contract was 'a licence to print money was much quoted

In relating the story to Julie, he decided to bend the truth just enough to make her think he had really been in danger.
In his warped attempt to bend the truth completely out of shape, ....
The room was double booked for a convention and a wedding in the same night.
KGB had always been on the lookout for hard facts, but then reported those facts to people besotted with a dream, who then bent the truth in the service of that dream. When the truth had finally broken through, the dream had suddenly evaporated like a cloud of steam in a high wind, and reality had poured in like the flood following the breakup of an icebound river in springtime.

They're prone to giving away their rations and living off the smell of an oily rag.
Can you believe somebody would just run over a cat like that?
They had the smell of an oily rag to work on.
There remains ABC Radio, which is the best known example of the relationship between the smell of an oily rag and the will to keep going.

Some crossed out words
"I guess it ain't all bad," Kerr said, lighting another cigarette. "I'm on the clock, so I'm getting paid while I wait."

I can cross off another project from the list.
If a fare paid him no more than what was on the clock, he'd shout out: "If you can't afford cabs you should take the 'bus."
It's a passable substitute, but it will never measure up to the original.
The obvious advantages of this method of new motor vehicle delivery over long distances,, which the L.M.R. says dealers and ultimate customers are beginning to appreciate, are all-weather reliability, arrival in mint condition and with only a very small mileage "on the clock", and the assurance that the car has not been mishandled during its running-in period; ….

Watching the way the Pirates cut up the pea patch with their merciless hitting and precision fielding, the New Yorkers grew more dejected.
As companies keep paring down their delivery times – from two days to a day to two hours to an hour – longer stretches of the last mile will have to run through urban territory.
I don't really know where to begin, but I guess I can take a crack at it and see how I do.
Would you like to take a stab at explaining the theory?
Soon, we got up, walked around the west side — toward the "meat rack" — the gay part of the park. There, it was as if someone had hung a line of marionettes on the railing: the lonesome young homosexuals, legs dangling, looking, waiting for that one-night's sexual connection...
Jimmy Carter is the third President in a row to take a stab at reforming the “welfare mess” — an almost obligatory pejorative of political oratory.
In many quarters, "it is important to be a good drunk to fit in socially" (make that across the board if you are male).

I've a perfectly decent outlook. My father was rather a swell in his science. I'm an entirely decent and respectable person." / "I beg to differ," said Mr. Pope. / "But I am." / "Again," said Mr. Pope, with great patience, and a slight forward bowing of the head, "I beg to differ."
It is the policy of the organization to keep unused check supplies safeguarded under lock and key.
Most of the conversation was taken up with an agonised appraisal of the Prince's [i.e., Charles, Prince of Wales's] proper role, together with much royal muttering (conventional wisdom in 1985) that Britain had lost its dynamism for which it was once famous. I begged to differ, and implored the Prince to consider the new, entrepreneurial, street-cred economy being created at that very moment in the clubs and streets, the fashion houses and TV studios and advertising agencies of Soho and Covent Garden.
Now the pluralists may say that a place where they run up new houses, and pull down old ones, is by no means disqualified for occupation, but he begs to differ from them decidedly.
Esther Lardent, chief consultant to the ABA's Post Conviction Death Penalty Representation Project, which has helped recruit pro bono lawyers for death row appeals since 1987, begs to differ.

Fortunately, bowerbirds cannot talk, so we are free to use sexual selection to explain their work, without them begging to differ.
… I saw this morning that the Supreme Leader of Iran said that street challenge is not acceptable. This is challenging democracy after the elections. Well, we beg to differ and the people of Iran are begging to differ. When you can count paper ballots, millions of them, within a couple of hours, something's funny.
If The Adventures Of Tintin and The BFG suggested that the director's craftsmanship rarely extends to entirely CGI worlds, this IMAX-scaled spectacle begs to differ.
If we all chip in, we can afford to buy a pizza for lunch.
He chipped in twenty for the retirement gift.
He knows they are in the short strokes—it's almost over.
Ironing out the short strokes has taken a little longer than expected, but it all should be worth the wait for Strawberry when the Yankees officially announce today they have re-signed the rehabbed slugger.
She can evoke an entire scene in short strokes, as in this from "The Wamsutter Wolf": "This trailer was in ruins, broken-backed because its west end had slipped off the cinder-block supports. All the windows had been shot out."
"You should never count Lyndon out," Nixon said. "When it comes down to the short strokes, there's no one who can handle them better than Lyndon Johnson.

Previously, shoppers were given a free ride on charges until the end of the month. Now interest will start on the day of purchase on accounts with balances.

The burst of anger was out of character for the normally placid boy.
In “Treehouse Of Horror” episodes, the rules aren’t just different—they don’t even exist.

The comedian stepped out of character to mug directly to the audience.
[J]ust about everyone who helped create this mess is busy pointing fingers, scapegoating the other guys, firing the lower-downs and diming out the higher-ups. Last week what was once envisioned as a new kind of company resembled little more than a circular firing squad of executives, accountants, consultants and lawyers.
Maybe God just calls a spade a spade, when the president talks to God.
Alexander Loudon, Netherlands Minister to the U.S., when asked if the blessed event was in prospect, hedged: "A royal child born on the soil of freedom-loving America would be both a blessing and a good omen."
Mr. Spenlow told me this day week was Dora's birthday, and he would be glad if I would come down and join a little picnic on the occasion. . . . I think I committed every possible absurdity in the way of preparation for this blessed event.
There was a time not so long ago when a company poised to go public would invite a reporter inside to memorialize the moments leading up to the blessed event.

“‘Nuremberg defense’, universally pleaded in war crimes trials,” is in actuality the Nuremberg nondefense, universally rejected in war crimes trials. It is a pity that the law of the Nuremberg Tribunal is so little understood after the passage of nearly a quarter of a century.
“It seems like he's [Charles Graner's] wanting to do the Nuremberg defense: ‘I was following orders,’” says Thomas Moran, a Houston attorney and a former military lawyer.
Why waste breath saying self-evident things?
Lloyds TSB's 1996 accounts show that the executive fallout following the takeover of TSB by Lloyds meant the departure of two executives clutching substantial golden handshakes.
We cannot say we are uniformly favourably impressed with such portions of the work as we have read. The work strikes us as being rather unequal. Like the curate's egg, parts of it are excellent, but parts provide bad material for assimilation.
But what does he give us? A mess of pottage—or a curate's egg, if you prefer that—where fine, descriptive passages in good English, and showing a sensitive nature that appreciates beauty, go cheek by jowl with bad grammar, and casual intimacies such as one would look for in the personal story of a Simplicissimus.
Like the fabled "curate's egg," it may be good in parts. I agree with the last speaker in regard to the State having control of the appointmentof the directors, but I also endorse his objections to some other powers that are given under the Bill.
These punctual jaunts, very sensibly practised as a purge against dullness, together with the stir and hubbub of a garrison town in which his walled garden stood isolated, as it were, all day long, amid marchings, countermarchings, bugle-calls, and the rumble of wagons filled with material of war, gave him a sense of being in the swim—of close participation in the world's affairs.
But "he's right there in the center of things, in the swim of art history."
The neat and tidy temporal ordering is, like the curate's egg, good in parts, but only in some parts. Neither of us vaunts much competence in the egg world, but it must have been rotten, the curate's egg.
"Bush's tax plan offers next to nothing to average Americans, while giving away the store to multimillionaires," said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.
They hoped for an amicable solution, but both knew it would require some give and take.
[T]he Prime Minister was listened to with respect when he replied to Opposition hints that Ethiopia was being sold down the river because Britain was afraid she or her ships might suddenly be attacked by Italian airmen.

"What's the point? Your buddies can kick back and relax. I'm going into voluntary retirement." / "Oh?" / "Tell you the truth, I was getting a little tired of Jim Shorter. Tired of that little room on Ninety-fourth Street. You know what I might do? I might leave town."
Truman bought quite a bill of goods from the old cronies who had flocked to Harriman.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Eli Lilly subsidiaries funnelled millions of dollars to government employees in other countries to secure business and did little to follow up on red flags.
This year's commemorations of the start of World War One are a stark reminder of the sacrifices politicians make with other people's lives – except nowadays they'll do so wearing a Help for Heroes t-shirt (almost entirely covering their brass necks). When it comes to the hypocritical lauding of the armed forces while simultaneously shafting them, no one does it better than this government.
I didn’t know the store closes at five on Thursdays. Oh well, I’ll have to come back tomorrow.
Oh well, I guess.
"Oh well, it can't be helped," returned Teal. "We'll get him yet. By the way, walk down to the lecture with me this afternoon?"
I'll catch a tongue-thrashing, I warrant … Oh well, I guess I'll risk it. I'd feel unhappy all day if I didn't.

Give her time, and she may come around and see things your way.
Work is a dirty word to him.
[H]undreds of joggers and walkers from the condos hit the bricks of the Coal Harbor Seawalk starting at 6 a.m. for their morning constitution around Stanley Park.
Alas, Hancock did not have his receipt, so the shop owner told him to hit the bricks.
He flunked out of high school as a youth, but finished school later in life.
When Harry Bridges told his boys to hit the bricks, Charley was always up front in the longshoremen's wall of flesh. His picketing record in the bloody dockside strife of 1934 and in the all-out strike of 1937 was perfect.
They could simply have replied, "No, we're way too square. And until you do come up with an answer, stick to the syllabus so that we don't have to flunk out your mixed-up students when we get them next quarter."
Life in the big city was a far cry from his upbringing on a quiet, small farm.
Brienne intervenes in the story of Jaime Lannister, adding to his legend with the exploits she believes paint the picture of him that deserves to live on. Her words are a far cry from those Jaime used to describe himself at their last encounter, instead recounting his deeds and ending with the simple, “He died protecting his queen,” a sentence that belies the complicated mix of nobility and tragedy entwined in his actions.
It's a far cry from a previous trip on a Class 150, where the set wheezed and vibrated so much as it staggered up Dainton Bank that I thought it was going to shake itself to bits!
It's really not so hard, once you know the nuts and bolts of the editing process.
Perhaps those who analyze the prospects for government in an Islamic state based on the works of these theorists forget that, after the revolution, lofty ideals and Utopias are discarded for the nuts and bolts of day-to-day governing.
I held down that job for years.
It also involves working with the nuts and bolts of management and leadership.
He stripped down to a pair of see-through briefs that left nothing to the imagination. (World Weekly News, 16-04-1991)
Deciding to go for the gold, he leaned close to Luke's ear and whispered, "Can you tell Mama I should have a dog? A really big dog?"

Sitting in an armchair beside a blazing fire in a community centre, Mr. Saakashvili rhymed off a list of his government's accomplishments.
He plans to hire somebody to do the grunt work of digging the trenches for the pipes.
He's standing at the edge, and I think he's about to jump.
Some Janizaries predicted that Justice Douglas would eventually be either Secretary of State or Chairman of the Defense Commission. He had given the President valiant aid in the campaign, in ideas and memoranda for the six speeches, and was still a chief figure in the palace politics of the inner circle.

And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
After several financial failures, the organization went belly up.
He bellied up to the bar as soon as he saw a free stool.
"The criminal cases against Thanathorn show the military government's contempt for the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful dissent. It's a glaring example of how draconian laws are pulled out of thin air and arbitrarily enforced to punish the prominent opposition leader," he said.
So we ran, full tilt boogie. Behind us, the footsteps echoed. ¶ Natalie and I shot around the corner. Before our pursuers appeared, I pointed up. Natalie flapped to the roof. I scrambled after her.
Could you speak up? I can't hear you.
I feel that somebody has to speak up for those oppressed by the system.
Writing a textbook has become more a labor of love than a money-making enterprise, wrote the professor, because of the peculiar way the books are now marketed.
Judging from the spectrum and the brightness Dr Stickland “wouldn′t give two bob either way”.
Speak up if I'm bothering you.

"A little bit of bread and no cheese!" cry the yellowhammers petulantly. But no one takes any notice of them.
Look you, Amanda, you may build castles in the air, "and fume, and fret, and grow thin and lean, and pale and ugly, if you please." But I tell you, no man worth having is true to his wife, or can be true to his wife, or ever was, or will be so.
I'll be gone for a few days, but I hope you will carry on in my absence.
She had a vivid imagination; [ … ] and it is a fact, that while she was dressing for dinner, and after she had asked Amelia whether her brother was very rich, she had built for herself a most magnificent castle in the air, of which she was mistress, with a husband somewhere in the background (she had not seen him as yet, and his figure would not therefore be very distinct); [ … ]
He carried on a long conversation with the dragoman in Turkish, the upshot of which was that he would give me a "buyuruldu" or special order to go to Sivas, and would provide an escort if the British Consul would send a written guarantee that I was a bona fide traveller.
We used to build castles in the air. We had big dreams. I'm not sure if you still have those dreams, but I still have dreams.

I really wish you wouldn't carry on like that in public!
It was necessary for them to rediscover fire, to relearn the basic laws of economics and rebuild civilization out of the ashes of ruin.
Rain had been predicted for that day and, sure enough, it was beginning to rain.
I thought he was my friend, but all the time he was carrying on with my wife!
"All kidding aside, Carlysle . . ." "Carla," I corrected him automatically. "I'm too used to thinking of you as 'Carlysle' and male to change both at once . . . All kidding aside, it'd be better for you not to stay on here any longer than the storm."

Locally and across the nation, middle schools have generally been regarded as the problem child for school systems.
He's a poster child for militant vegetarianism.
I think he smile could have opened the door by itself. It seemed to have a life of it’s^([sic]) own with snow-white teeth below sparkling blue eyes. Its owner could be the poster child for the expression “grinning from ear to ear.”
He’s not exactly a poster child for the average well-adjusted American kid. He’s only been in-country for a few days.
We had the car going flat chat down the highway when the cops pulled us over.
I spun around yet again and took off flat chat.
A visit to Adventure Island–an after-school program developed by Robert Slavin and Nancy Madden, professors at Johns Hospkins University and creators of Success for All, a comprehensive school reform program practiced in hundreds of schools across the country–could be the poster child for what some might call the academic approach.
Can you call me back tomorrow, mate? I′m flat chat at the moment.
Sorry, I′m flat chat with work. I don′t see how you can get away until Saturday.
Except that I was too flat chat to get up and collect it myself so I motioned to Wok as surreptitiously as I could, nodding in the direction of the note lying invitingly on the asphalt. Wok stared back at me uncomprehendingly.
He finally let slip that they plan to take over the business.
Brunhilde, a kind of earth-mother goddess, carries a torch for her lost love.
It took me about 20 minutes there and back.
"I don't suppose anyone from the director down will come out of this deal smelling like a rose," the warden commented, "but our only hope is that some good will result from the hearing."
But compared to others, Dent came out of the Depression "smelling like a rose." He later boasted that he made $18,000 a year with his writing during the Depression.
You don't need to tell me about depression. I've been there and back.
I have a great deal of sympathy with scientific doubters, and with those who test psychicism up hill and down dale and are not satisfied.
She didn't play polo, though she seemed crazy for a chance. She was very insistent while the men refused to let her hazard her skin in the game, but when they finally consented she was attacked by what the vulgar call "cold feet" and renigged.
Yer can't even fight unless you've got a knife or picket or broken bottle, yer gutless wonder.
Says Bergsma: "We were flooded with financial types who didn't have their own skin in the game"
On a rainy Saturday, after a busy week at work, he closed the curtains and decided to sleep in.
He carried a cellular phone so that friends could reach him when he was out and about.
A good suitcase is essential for someone who is on the go as much as he is.
First Kings 9:10-10:29 brings us back to see the glory of this empire. It is glory that must now be seen with respect to 8:22-53 and 9:1-9. It is therefore glory under a cloud, destined to fade away.
Not a low baker's dozen, you will perceive, but two high banker's dozen!
A man accused of a crime is entitled to a speedy trial, not merely because he is under a personal restraint, but also because his reputation is under a cloud, as long as the criminal accusation remains undisposed of.
It concludes with a banker's dozen of 11 items labeled "What to Read" — a well chosen list on the urban, technological disruption of man's life and the earth's biosphere.
The enlarged Chilean navy was placed under the command of dashing Lord Cochrane, a very distinguished admiral of the British Royal Navy, then under a cloud at home, who took service under the Chilean flag, [ … ] .

“The department feels it's got to suspend any cop who's under a cloud if they're going to maintain public faith in the system. [ … ] "
“Did she resign?” Cherry asked. “No, Dr. Fairall fired her. Zelda left here under a cloud. Sort of mysterious. I never found out exactly."
That guy might be a few cards shy of a full deck — he thinks that substitute sugar is really a government tracking system.
Thanks for coming in. Please, have a seat.
[A] series of mishaps including the sinking of INS Sindhurakshak in August last year has put him under a cloud.
The cost of toothpaste is small change compared to the cost of dental work.
He's a self-satisfied klutz who aspires to be a con artist. . . . Compared with Lawrence, Freddy is small change.
The austerity of my tone seemed to touch a nerve and kindle the fire that always slept in this vermilion-headed menace to the common weal, for she frowned a displeased frown and told me for heaven's sake to stop goggling like a dead halibut.
As I recall, his book had to do with alien abductions.
Artists' books seldom dip a toe into literature.
Surfers Paradise is just over the border in Queensland, and I was eager to dip a toe into that interesting and erratic state.
Does this have anything to do with the party you were planning?
The two concepts are often confused, but they actually have very little to do with each other.
Yes, I have a car, but what does that have to do with whether I am qualified for a desk job?
She says she doesn't want anything to do with him anymore.
The time had come, Dundee acknowledged, to decide if he was serious about making a run for the roses. It was only mid-1990, but presidential campaigns had evolved into two-year affairs, and if he really had that famous "fire in his belly," now was the time.
I thought about leaps of faith, runs for the roses, and reaching for the stars.
Over the years, he developed a reputation as a penny pincher who wouldn't spend money for anything.
Leadbetter needs to be thwacked with a legal clue stick. The law he's talking about applies only to Internet service providers, not reporters.
I think the author needs a good whack with the clue stick.
This oil deposit is a regular gold mine. We make more and more money every year!
And you shall do nothing but what you choose, and shall be as happy as the day is long.
They are quiet, peaceable, tractable, free from drunkenness, and they are as industrious as the day is long.
The possessors of Salisbury & Yeovil Railway shares had ample compensation for the anxiety which the first few years of the company's existence had given them, for the concern proved a veritable gold mine.
Monica: Alright, wait a second! Why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are "as gay as the day is long"?
Two good reasons spring to mind at once.
I decided there could be a nice bit of irony in a situation where a boxer, with a crown his for the taking, deliberately takes a dive to get revenge on the man he hates, who is betting everything on the boxer's victory.
You got a fight next weekend. You take a dive in the fourth round, understand?
Does it take an act of Congress just to get a stop sign on a corner?
Should Frederick stick around — and apparently it would take an act of Congress to get him out of the ICU — he might take up where Molly had brutally left off.
The businessman turned promoter rejected some of overseas rumors going around that Klitschko bet a large portion of funds on himself and then took a dive to collect.
Another problem was bureaucratic: the transfer of the ship required, literally, an act of Congress. It was an agonizing process that ground along for twenty-six months, through the tenures of three secretaries of the navy, two presidents, and two mayors of New York.
The lad does not take kindly to being asked to shun bad company.
The training that opens doors for you that men from electrical trade schools can never pass.
A national political party is unlikely to feel it has a particular dog in the hunt for a typical small town mayoral race; in many cases the local candidates do not even campaign with a party affiliation.
An English passenger, taking kindly to me, drew me into conversation. He was older than I. He asked me what I ate, what I was, where I was going, why I was shy, and so on. He also advised me to come to table. He laughed at my insistence on abjuring meat, [ … ]
The likeness of the great bass horn remained upon the retina of his mind's eye, losing nothing of its brazen enormity with the passing of hours, nor abating, in his mind's ear, one whit of its fascinating blatancy.
Other people do "Don't Smoke in Bed" and "I've Got Your Number" and "You Came a Long Way From St. Louis," but when I hear them in my mind's ear, hers is the voice I hear.
I'm not getting into a pissing contest with him over who has the fastest car.
"‘Anybody resigns from us resigns feet first, understand?’ he tells me. So I didn't resign."
She won him in a pissing contest.
Allen Gregory DeLongpre: Yeah, it's not a big deal. I lobbied for fuel-cell technology on Capitol Hill. I'm friends with Sandy Bullock, really good friends. Who cares? It's not a pissing contest, right, J?
Everything seems to be going wrong today.
Right then I lost the plot. I did, man, I went over the edge.
Finally, I lost the plot. I got into my car and drove to the police station.
Of course they are far from perfect, of course we are more than ready to welcome constructive improvements to them, but I beg Parliament and also Member Governments not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Apologise for losing the plot and explain what made you react the way you did.
But while there remains a considerable degree of consensus that the consequence of apparently losing the plot sometime between 1914 and 1918 was the cultural and economic malaise of the 1920s and 1930s, there are still some who look back on the interwar years less with criticism than with nostalgia.
Because of this it seems to me that we have somehow lost the plot and we're in desperate need of balance. The idea of Protestant ministers touching the body of Christ (the bread) with great love and tenderness like the priest described is almost incomprehensible.
[Professor Fearnley:] If I can perhaps be a little unkind about my profession — which is fair enough I suppose — I think the accountancy profession, along with other professions, loses the plot from time to time and has to be pulled back from what it was doing before.
All to be done and dusted before the National Honey Show. After this the grand clear up.
The requests piled up while she was away.
There are the engines that develop ill-health and begin to lose time, or the wagons that develop hot boxes and have to be removed, initiating delays that steadily pile up—or at worst, the weather lays its hand on the whole District.
If we're all in agreement about how to proceed, let's get the show on the road.
Watch out for low doorways, so you don’t hit your head.
They do not measure each one, but they do a spot check on a few parts before shipping.
His primary opponent, Raphael Herman, is a real estate salesman who frankly admits he knows beans about insurance.
They spot check the rooms periodically for problems.
He fell in a puddle and ended up covered head to toe in mud.
The new design is very edgy and certainly flies in the face of tradition.
He was on his first vacation in ten years and he figured he had it coming to him.
But when the shock had faded, more hard-headed reaction set in. This wasn’t just the feeling that, however tactfully you dress it up, the United States had it coming.
Although one might baulk at giving an 83-year-old a hard time, this particular 83-year-old has it coming.
It was his first attempt at cooking, but I tried it and it was not half bad.
The repairs on this nuclear reactor have burned out every welder in the province.
His burn out hadn't been caused by too many dead bodies; it was from spending his life doing for people what most of them had refused to do for themselves.
He was a normal horny boy who flogged the log with the best of them.
[T]he ‘fun’ factor may be in part attributable the novelty of the feedback mechanism, and the sense of fun might wear thin after longer exposure to the feedback method.
Ever since our benevolent overlords, the Japanese, began to panic everything has been all turned around.
Look, the benevolent overlord attitude might have gone a lot further for you back in the day, but don't even think you can use it on me.
After finding both stairwells untenable at the roof, the Captain and the rookie take the window‐washing scaffold—any port in a storm—down the side of the building to the fire floor.
He wasn't the most popular appointment, but I think the phrase ‘any port in a storm’ came to mind when we were getting turned down by everyone.
A. "You won't know Paris, I suppose." B. As it happens, I went to university there!
The question is not whether I still enjoy the job, when I never enjoyed it in the first place.
In the first place, let's get the basics settled.
Why does this exist in the first place?
The stock plan really served as golden handcuffs for the executives.
Do you think they can get by on only one salary?
I didn't wear my “Trailer Park Trash” T-shirt that day.
I swear, this whole thing sounds like we're talking about some hillbilly trailer park trash.
Eric's remark about “trailer park trash” is strictly his. I have some very good friends who live in trailers and they are not trash.
That is why one should never bring a knife to a gunfight, a worm should not challenge Godzilla, and a chump should never box a boxer.
[W]e can shoot down missiles. . . . Our Kingfisher sonars can detect mines. . . . Our ships are hardened against chemical and biological weapons. But how do you stop a torpedo? . . . The best engineers in the business agree that nearly every class of torpedo currently being deployed has the capacity to sink one of our ships with a single shot. . . . [W]e are the poor bastards that brought a knife to a gunfight.
Hey now sleepy head, it's time for you to go to bed.
This is the secret of Hegel, and the key to his hieroglyphics, and, if consistently used to interpret the sayings of his logic, it becomes an open book.
On the surface of the ground or through the swaying branches of the trees the spoor of man or beast was an open book to the ape-man, but even his acute senses were baffled by the spoorless trail of the airship.
He is an open book. Everyone can see that he removes nothing, conceals nothing, reserves nothing for himself.
Emile's most striking characteristic is that he hides nothing. He is an open book, acting the same in private as in public — "Emile is worse at disguising his feelings than any man in the world."
For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
They would fob us off with that and once more make it six and two threes.
He was, I believe, not in the least an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he would not suffer fools gladly.
I'll leave it up to you whether you wish to include it; in other words, it's six and two threes.
I went all to pieces when my brother died.
All floor traders are of a kind, and most burn out by their late thirties.
"When you say she was a tart, do you mean a whore?" "It's the same difference," Betty said.
I think he was somewhat lost for a political position - a simple conservatism did not attract him - and I make the guess that Arnold had been a spar that he got hold of as he struggled to find a political position. I was certainly in that position, having been persuaded by Anderson, especially at the lunch-hour meetings of his Free-thought Society, of the bankruptcy of the Left. Arnold came to me as a most welcome ray of light.
Yes, I ate the last cookie. What of it?
Already in the hopper was another bill, by Florida's stanch New Deal Senator Claude Pepper, to outlaw poll taxes altogether.
"Hiram took my snowballs." "Aw, what of it, kid?" sneered the bully. "There's lots more snow. Make yourself another set and see what you can do."
"By Gar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us! I guess he won't show his face in this valley again."
The cookies, though soft and gooey, proved a smash hit at the party.
We haven't been able to pay rent for five months. Next month we'll be on the street.
All undergraduate libraries have been a screaming success as study halls. The Undergraduate Library of the University of Michigan may be the smash hit of all time; the attendance in that library during 1968-69 was 1,899,000.
But to work "on the street" is clearly quite different from "working the street."
For the renowned sushi chef, it was a guilty pleasure to eat fish sticks drowned in tartar sauce.
We all have guilty pleasures, don't we? During the summer of 1993, my guilty pleasure was watching Saved by the Bell reruns.
When he hit his finger with the hammer, he said "ouch" or words to that effect.
Hearing such words as these, in the sweetest, tenderest voice that ever caressed a lover's senses, Basil knew not how to word all that was in his heart. . . . Side by side, forgetful of all but their recovered peace, they talked sweet nothings.
[T]he facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings.
She's trying to meet my every need, waiting on me in ways that would make my mum bleat, What did your last slave die of?'
It is difficult to know how accurate this portrait is, and how much of it consists of sweet nothings whispered into the author's ear by loyal retainers.
Sooner or later the Catholic question will loom large in our way, so why not take a definite standpoint right from the beginning?
Nevertheless, even for a country bank, the unpredictable can loom large in the management of its reserve position.
At the same time, the environmental problems certainly loom large in all transition countries.
While the environmental damages might loom large, there are rather the changes on the social structure of the Wopkaimin community and the demands for more participation in the mine's benefits — in other words, there are also social and economical reasons for the emergence of conflicts as well.
Schmeichel was Denmark's hero as England sought the winner, saving brilliantly from Harry Maguire and Harry Kane as the game went into extra time and the prospect of penalties loomed large.
Energy policy will loom large in the policy decisions of the new government.
He read there in the raw what is perhaps the most amazing page in the history of human development, and in the end he was forced to the conclusion that all his early preconceptions had been at fault, and that it was such exalted, passionate enthusiasts as Vilmorin who had been right.
If you ask for it back Sunday he might return it along about Wednesday.
He stood gawking at Cyndee, who was standing in the raw on the shore of the pond his daddy had put in.
As he waited for Pamela to return, Richard was standing in the raw before his full-length mirror.
Similarly, Fingilish usually refers to transliterated Farsi in chatrooms, text messages, and the like.
And business runs in the family / We tend to bruise easily bad in the blood
What was that tackle about? The red mist still descends on Beckham occasionally.
On the face of it, this appears to have fit into a pattern that seems familiar with Vettel's errors in recent times. In stressed moments, a sort of red mist seems to descend that reduces his capacity for rational thinking.
These companies are simply paper companies . . . they farm out the contracts to the real builders.
The U.S. military had hoped to farm out the Bagram detainees to prisons run by Afghanistan and other nations.
There once lived, in a sequestered part of the county of Devonshire, one Mr Godfrey Nickleby: a worthy gentleman, who, taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married, and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune, had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment.
"Edith Bradin's coming," said some one to Gordon. "Didn't she used to be an old flame of yours? Aren't you both from Harrisburg?"
My performance seems somehow always to get worse when there are other people looking on.
I look on him not as a boss, but as a friend.
I don't care what I do. If it pays the bills and puts food on the table, I'm not bothered.
The locals bemoan the tourist crush and at the same time welcome it because it puts food on the table.
He had had a hard time in the City, so he explained. Harris, who is callous in his nature, and not prone to pity, said: "Ah! and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a change; change is good for everyone. Out you get!"
It goes without saying that our volunteers love their work.
"I've supported her for seventeen years. Why shouldn't she support herself for a change?"
"... But I ain't all softness and mush--feel this here for a change!" And I closed the Kid's eye with a smashing left hander.
It almost goes without saying that the train is fully soundproofed, with double-glazed windows and highly efficient air-conditioning by the British firm of J. Stone.
In the crisis, the company was forced to reduce its costs in order to avoid going under.
The reputation of the elder Baron, although by all accounts justly merited, was destined to be completely thrown into the shade by that of his son[…]

Every one has good sense enough to see other peoples' faults, and good nature enough to overlook their own.
The same streets that are inviting and quiet at high noon may be intimidating at night.
/mode/1up page 228: They had come to an open space of sunlight, which seemed to express to Syme the final return of his own good sense; and in the middle of this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that common sense in an almost awful actuality.
Escalation is the film's nuclear energy source. It's there, of course, in the downright lunatic stunts performed by Cruise, again defying good sense and his own advancing years to top his previous feats of reckless self-endangerment.
[ … ] whereas, ten years since, there were thousands who could not endure my lightest word of rebuke to the South, they can now easily swollow John Brown whole, and his rifle into the bargain. In firing his gun, he has merely told us what time of day it is. It is high noon, thank God!
It's no biggie. It should only take five minutes to make a new one.
For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager.
Sell her her waste, please, and give her good measure if you can make up your mind to do the liberal thing for once.
For once in her life she was surprised out of her reserve; she caught her girl in her arms and crushed her and her flowers against her heart, kissing the bright hair and sweet face warmly.
I'm not going to sit still and let him treat me this way.
She was, in addition, always extremely careful to share with the friends in her Support System her belief that it would be whiny and pathetic to play what she derisively called the "Blame Game" and blame her constant and indescribable adult pain on their parents' traumatic divorce or their cynical use of her.
We had a good deal more money after winning the lottery.
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly: so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
You may make a good deal of that little fact if properly worked.
A friend suggested that, if I really wanted to have the satisfaction of taking a difficult examination, I should pass the London Matriculation. It meant a good deal of labour and much addition to my stock of general knowledge, without any extra expense worth the name. I welcomed the suggestion. But the syllabus frightened me. Latin and a modern language were compulsory!
They cancelled the entire project because the new management didn't like the prototype, but I think they threw the baby out with the bathwater.
He has another appointment on Thursday. In other words, I don't think he'll be attending your gathering.
Hanks is known as being an avid reader of history and biography, and seems to seek out stories which offer a certain optimism and humanism. In other words, he plays – fundamentally – good people.
We have all these thousands of bill payers trying to dodge a bullet, trying to shift costs and pay less.
Haiti dodged a bullet when Tropical Storm Tomas, once a hurricane, did minimal damage to the country's earthquake-ravaged capital of Port-au-Prince.
We had some problems at the very beginning, but it's been smooth sailing since the second week or so.
Not that all was smooth sailing for MGM in Nazi Germany.
By finding and fixing my aneurysm before it ruptured, I had miraculously dodged a bullet.
What we need to restore faith in government is an Honest Abe.
I'm sure we're on a losing wicket but we're fighting technology.
Don't trust him, he's just doing the Honest Abe bit.
LAST year I was diagnosed with cervical cancer and had to pack in my job as a full-time cleaner as I needed chemo and radiotherapy
Though co-star Keanu Reeves considered this new trip unnecessary, the "Speed 2" crew has packed in lots of references from the original.
Jurgis lost his temper very little, however, all things considered.
Yet, all things considered, she was not of an evil mind or an unkindly disposition.
All things considered, he would not have been such a bad match for Ida, only that I knew the child did not really care about him, and there was Georgie breaking her proud, patient little heart for his sake, and nobody saw it but one old woman, who had been through it all herself, and knew what it meant.
We had a good stock of tea, with which we treated our friends, as above, and we lived very cheerfully and well, all things considered.
This mystery has vexed us all hitherto; perhaps you will be able to shed light upon the matter, Inspector.
Damn, see that guy on the dance floor? He can bust a move! That, my friend, is groovin'.
I'm gonna bust a move on that fine ass bitch.
Taking classes in a subject is a good way to test the waters and explore a potential career.
"Bust a move, it's The Man."
I hope I don't slip up during my presentation.
"Hey, did you see Bob last night with that chick?" "Yeah, he had to bust a move and got laid."

I live off nothing in this world / Except the thick grey air that chains itself / Swirls all around and engrains itself
Part of that memorandum of Mr. Hanshue's refers to directors sitting pretty in thinking they were all set for certain benefits.
Lauren Hutton, 28, was sitting pretty. The omnipresent model had just signed a two-year, $200,000 contract.
I asked her if she realized Michael could be killed in Iraq and she had laughed and said it wouldn't matter as long as she had the baby she would be sitting pretty with his death benefits.
That's not a threat, sir, for they have played fair with me, and I sha'n't sacrifice a penny of their money—unless they force me to do so. But—I'm in control. I'm sitting pretty. They can't unseat me, and I warn them not to try.
Not long after that, the band seemed to drop off the radar entirely, leading many to assume that they had broken up...

"What he did to her was wrong." "You knows it, sister!"
Mose would ha rallied, ef eed a been in our ward — ha ! ha ! ha ! — you knows it, Mass Richard !

"Let's tie one on!" said Peachy gaily. "Come on, Eve!", Eve said she couldn't drink a thing. "Besides, it's fattening!"
We welcome you, you knows it. Didn't even need to ask, but it fine all right you did.
"Oh, cut it," said Steve wearily. " . . . I don't want to listen to drivel like that." "Drivel?" repeated the other, puzzled. " . . . I don't see why you need to get so hot under the collar.
"What do you mean, sir?" cried the old boy, getting purple. . . . "Now don't get hot under the collar. I'm only asking. I've a right to know."
The Tennessee Football fans who couldn't buy Sugar Bowl tickets were furious, but it's a toss-up whether they were any hotter under the collar than some of those who got them.
A controversial history textbook has IFP members hot under the collar and has resulted in two protest marches being scheduled for KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday.
It is a perplexing expression, since many of these young people were not in the "wrong place." ... I believe that when they say "I guess I was in the wrong place at the wrong time," they are reflecting on the randomness of violence.
"Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!" Lem said. "I've heerd of rifles with transits on 'em, but I ain't ever seen one. Mind if I look at her?"
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle, I actually solved that one.
… I made as if to step inside—wham, bang, I'll be a monkey's uncle if he didn't slam the door in my face! What was I supposed to do now? It wasn't exactly a cheerful situation.
But I know I am better than that. I completed two and a half years at the M.J.C., and I'll be a monkey's uncle if I did it all just to be neglected in some backwoods, drafty, lo-tech, no-glory, never-been-remembered-for-all-the-great-things-I-do, dead end court wizard position.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle if it isn't my old pal, Captain Pete. I haven't seen you in years. Good to see you!

Afore we got to the shanty Colonel Applegate stuck his head out of the door. His temper had been getting raggeder all the time, and the sousing he got when he fell overboard had just about ripped what was left of it to ravellings.
The demanding interview panel took him well out of his comfort zone.
Right, the committee has considered your request and denied it, so there you are.
After completing a medical and the requisite paperwork on Tuesday to seal the deal, Di María said: “I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester United. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Spain and there were a lot of clubs interested in me, but United is the only club that I would have left Real Madrid for.
That was harsh on the former Manchester United keeper after a performance which kept his team in the tie at times. But Grant, so often starved of luck himself, will feel both he and his side were worthy of the good fortune. Only time will tell whether it will be enough.
After all the hype, all the fever pitch build-up, the encounter never really lived up to expectations – as is so often the case with derbies – and the atmosphere was even a little subdued at times.
a Filipino representative at the Greenlake, 1981 conference said that the ‘…partnership is often like the proverbial “horse and rabbit stew” supposedly mixed in equal proportions, that is, one horse to one rabbit.'

If the pen is mightier than the sword in American history, it is more likely the pen of a novelist than the typewriter of a reporter — Harriet Beecher Stowe stimulating antislavery sentiment or Upton Sinclair enlisting citizens in outrage against the food-processing industry.
That picture wasn't much to look at, being so old and all, but Mrs. Oaks made like it looked so nice; or, that's what she said as she stared at it, looking back and forth at the picture and me like it wasn't so. Only, she just didn't know how so it wasn't. It wasn't me at all.
If my teachers had not told me that the pen is mightier than the sword, if my parents had not told me that I have to respect books, I would not have developed that respect for knowledge.
The nice guy, they say, finishes last. But in romantic relationships, the nice guy often isn't even in the running. [ … ] The nice guy may have expressed an interest in dating you…. The nice guy is the person who you trust and feel comfortable with, but don't see as "fun" or "challenging" or really all that "interesting," other than as a friend, of course.
"My frustrations were pretty typical Nice Guy relationship issues," he says. "Not feeling appreciated, not feeling sexually desired by my wife. I didn't feel like...I received as much as I gave."
Nice guys are historically the grail of dating. [ … ] As both Nora and I reminisced and compared how we were treated by the manwhore and by the nice guy, the manwhore always won out.
He'd begin with a premise and wrap it up at the end, full circle, the moral of the story hanging on the last word of the last line.

Now that the dog has stopped barking, perhaps we can at last get some rest.
After three hundred years had passed, at last the vampire's soul was free.
Upon balancing the account, the profit at last will hardly countervail the inconveniences that go along with it.
No matter how early I came down, I would find him on the veranda, smoking cigarettes, or[ … ]. And at last I began to realize in my harassed soul that all elusion was futile, and to take such holidays as I could get, when he was off with a girl, in a spirit of thankfulness.

I'd record it, but my tape deck is on the fritz again.
My washing machine has gone on the fritz, and I have a load of muddy clothes to clean.
You've got a piece of tail. I want a piece of tail too.
Actually, no one had noticed, from what I could tell, though I was alarmed to hear about it. Why was our pilot telling us about questionable brakes and a computer on the fritz when we still had a landing to worry about five hours ahead?
No ′40s movie heroine worth the name would have a house that let in gusts of gelid air, had a heating system that went on the fritz constantly and leaked.

The London Stock Exchange is to enhance the measures it has in place to ensure ‘fat finger’ trades do not occur.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is on the case, pursuing a lead that a "fat finger" keystroke error on a trade in Procter & Gamble, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, turned a trade of millions into a trade of billions.
A typical operational risk that needs to be countered is the ‘fat finger’ where, in stressful and fast-moving markets, a trader might key in a wrong order. There are numerous examples where such an order moved the market and generated a loss for the executing firm. A fat finger limit will prevent a portfolio manager keying in a trade with a size beyond a particular trigger level.
Someone with fat fingers pressed a wrong number is my guess. I suppose I'd better give them a ring and fess up.
I must have dialed the wrong number. Fat fingers and all that.

"I'll learn 'im to insult a respectable British tradesman. I'll show him who's who."
I wish you wouldn't make light of the matter, when it obviously means a great deal to him.
It was also a satisfying night for England coach Capello. Not only did he have a vital victory to celebrate, but his team selection was fully justified as Cahill gave an almost flawless performance in defence and Scott Parker's display made light of the surprising exclusion of Frank Lampard.
He came in with a suitcase, packed to the gills with samples and demonstration products.
It’s a film that is utterly maximalist, stuffed to the gills with gadgets, gimmicks, ideas both good and bad. An exhausting, exhilarating watch.
After all, if these measures could've succeeded, they would've been implemented five years ago when the world economy hadn't yet hit the skids.
The whole crowd cringed as he got hit right in the family jewels.
It was rumoured that the lady and the gentleman were keeping company.
He was keeping company with her.
But what do three testicles mean? A mystical trinity illuminating some absurd need to procreate? A symbol suggesting a metaphysic of pawnbroking? Likely as not, it is simply an animation of the familiar euphemism, "the family jewels."
The coach said, "We were doing well for a while, but they got tired and then the wheels fell off".

Alerting Nigeria to stay tuned for an important announcement, the government radio station canceled its regular programs.
NBC had spent weeks promoting Mr. Daly's new show, and had even commissioned a special original edition of Conan O'Brien's Late Night show . . . to give Mr. Daly's show the best possible lead-in. During his show, Mr. O'Brien twice urged viewers to stay tuned for Mr. Daly.

Yet they've proved that common men can show astonishing fortitude in chasing jam tomorrow.
The consumption-possibilities curve illustrates the choice which must be made: more jam today means less jam tomorrow; less jam today means more jam tomorrow.
For one-period optimization, the obvious course of action to maximize consumption is to consume the whole of output by “eating up” the capital stock. The inapplicability of this tactic to an industrializing nation is transparent—it gets a lot of jam for today but leaves little for tomorrow. Jam today has therefore to be balanced against jam tomorrow.

In 1916 the famed Van Sweringen brothers bought their first railroad—the Nickel Plate. . . . This year, as usual, the tarnished Nickel Plate cannot make the grade. In first seven months it lost $2,003,779.

We must note, too, the good position (third) gained by Esmond as an undeniable instance of the "horses for courses" theory, for Esmond won the Peverill of the Peek Plate on this course two years in succession—1892–3.
Almost immediately he went on to press for stricter standardisation in the future, saying that "horses for courses" was a luxury B.R. could not afford and that manufacturers must expect more detailed specifications from railway engineers in the future.
Not long ago, a group of Thames-side penthouses went up for sale with giveaway Ducati motorbikes worth £13,000 apiece. [ … ] "In many cases giveaways are horses for courses, the inducements matching the styles of properties being marketed," he [David Hollingworth of London and Country Mortgages] adds.
Far be it from me to judge what anyone else finds attractive – each to their own, horses for courses, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and any number of similar well-meaning platitudes – but no one's going to start arguing forcefully that Mick [Hucknall]'s ever been 'classically handsome'.
Emailed greeting cards and digital photos may be more acceptable now, but are not a substitute for the post on every occasion. "People will still want to pour their heart out in letter or want that special photo of a grandchild. It's horses for courses," he [Alki Manias of NetValue] said.
However intense music becomes, there's always a limit to how far it can go. And that limit is marked out by its genre or style. [ … ] It's an age-old rule, this insistence on "horses for courses", but in the modern era many musicians have become impatient with it. They dream of a music that knows no limits, which can do everything, all at once.

Operation London Bridge, also from 1975, tells the story of the busy station's redevelopment.

As only a small per cent of the dealers use the word "Leghorn," and the ones who do try to use it can't tell a Leghorn from a mixed breed or from many other breeds, the most of the joke is on someone else.
It is reputed so great a shame to be accounted a lyer, that any other injury is cancelled by giving the lie; and he that receiveth it, standeth so charged in his honor and reputation, that he cannot disburden himselfe of that imputation, but by striking of him that hath so giuen it, or by challenging him the combat.
The great Violation of the Point of Honour from Man to Man, is giving the Lie. One may tell another he Whores, Drinks, Blasphemes, and it may pass unresented; but to say he Lies, tho’ but in Jest, is an Affront that nothing but Blood can expiate.
Whatever injury was the initial cause of the quarrel, conflict might move into its physically violent phase only through the particular act of resentment constituted by giving the lie.
The working relationship between Amtrak and the contracting railroads, and the Government for that matter, is not, and has never been all sweetness and light, and many railroads still find the passenger train to be a hindrance to the beloved freight.

This book could be in any nook or cranny of the house.
[Aunt Dahlia] had done Wilbert well where sleeping accommodation was concerned. What he had drawn when clocking in at Brinkley Court was the room known as the Blue Room, a signal honour to be accorded to a bachelor guest, amounting to being given star billing, for at Brinkley, as at most country-houses, any old nook or cranny is considered good enough for the celibate contingent. My own apartment, to take a case in point, was a sort of hermit's cell in which one would have been hard put to it to swing a cat, even a smaller one than Augustus, not of course that one often wants to do much cat-swinging.
There's not a nook or cranny that I haven't looked in.

Boris Johnson, never one to fuss about detail, does not realise that without a deal there will be no implementation period. No withdrawal agreement means just that—no agreement. Just out. End of. But as both contenders now consider no deal a serious option, we need to be 100% honest about the implications[.]
They felt themselves lords and masters of the universe, with power over life and death.
The Masters of the Universe were a set of lurid, rapacious plastic dolls that his otherwise perfect daughter liked to play with.

Whether it was politics, trade, competition in industry, snobbery, boasting, self-advertisement, or gossip, the object was to score off one's adversary and put him down.
You'd be worked up if you had just been scored off by Aubrey Upjohn, with that loathsome self-satisfied look on his face as if he'd been rebuking a pimply pupil at his beastly school for shuffling his feet in church.

`Far be it from me,' he said, `to tell you, Weston, that any girl you'd find for me would meet with no danger on this expedition."
There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, and I have met several lamas, notably the Phodong Lama of Sikhim and others like him, men who were thoroughly capable, who acted up to their principles, and whom I thoroughly respected, but I am sorry to say such men were few and far between.

I would have spoken further, but before I could get under way the door opened, revealing Ma Cream, and [my manservant Jeeves] shimmered silently from the room. Unless expressly desired to remain, he always shimmers off when what is called the Quality arrive.
United could have made it 3-0 with further chances, but Norwich's Andrew Crofts also had a shot saved and his side can come away from this encounter with some reason to feel hard done by.

These terms . . . will place the future behavior of Germany at the dictation of the associated powers regardless of what form of provisional government may hold the reins at Berlin.
The convention also delivered a slap to the technocrats who have held the reins of government for more than a decade.

"My dear young friend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before the mind of Joseph. - Joseph!" said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a compassionate adjuration.
Smith, who’s still mulling over ways that she can “go Galt,” sees a possibility for a moral stand. During the Iraq War, she read about a painter who’d painted less, reducing his income, in order to dodge taxes and thereby make sure he didn’t fund the war.
We job creators are not going to take it. We are going Galt! Just like in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, we are gonna leave you parasites behind and relocate to an island where only rich people can live — Manhattan!
The bill came to a grand total of $2560.
Time had taken its toll on the old bridge, and it was no longer sound.
Heavy smoking and drinking will take its toll on a person's health.
The amount of space at the disposal of newspapers, and the want of something to talk about and write about, produced that mild autumnal effect known as the silly season, which sets in when there is a lull in politics, and a dearth of news.
The Brits call it the "silly season." In Germany the media call it the Sommerloch, literally "the summer hole." What they are referring to is the fact that when politicians and businesspeople close up shop and go away for the major European summer holidays, the number of serious news stories tends to diminish—meaning desperate hacks need to find something else to fill the hole.
Yes, Virginia, there is a presidential election in 1984—and it has begun: A former Vice President goes ice fishing and poses with a puny perch dangling from his line. A 68-year-old Senator dons athletic shorts and runs a 60-yd. dash in a San Francisco track meet. [ … ] Such hijinks can mean only one thing: the quadrennial silly season has started again.
The soldiers held their rifles at the ready and listened for the enemy.
… merely observing that if you were to give weight to such an objection, there is not a panel who would not be entitled to the same benefit …
The soldiers' rifles were at the ready.
Requiring concrete suggestions or motivations beyond those actually needed by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and failing to give weight to suggestions implicit from the prior art as a whole … errs on the side of issuing patents to obvious inventions …"
What were these 250 men to come for? – I imagined it was to give weight to the petition.
We soldiers don’t hate one another when the war is over, and maybe the fact that I’ve fought through it will give weight to my words.
It is a sore point with me, this being told what I am to do or not do by you self-constituted lords of creation.
[T]he talks have touched on Iran's suspected nuclear-weapons program, its sponsorship of terrorism and other sore points.
The representative from New Hampshire has the floor.
He was stuffed to the tonsils with cream crackers.
We had both been stuffed up to the tonsils with excellent food.
With resentments choking him up to the tonsils.
He hiked up his sagging trousers.
What Jack loves above all is a song with a rousing chorus... in which Jack can do his bit towards "raising the roof".
This is . . . why she raises the roof if he pays too much attention to another woman at a party.
They tried to make more money by putting lots of salt in the popcorn and hiking up the price of drinks.
Jubilant Liberal supporters raised the roof of a Mississauga restaurant after incumbent Albina Guarnieri was swept back into office for her seventh term.

I have been called hot shit before, never knew what hot shit was, better than cold shit I guess.
Jolie knows she's hot shit right now and next year, at this time, she will probably be hotter shit.
There's too much attention paid to the wrong issues. Let's just damn the torpedoes and get it done.
This lad Kelley is an odd duck in many ways. . . . Unlike most college youngsters, he has no hobbies.
Is [Peter] O'Toole—skinny, tottering, eccentric in everything from costume to line-readings—wonderful in this role? Indeed he is. Always more of an odd duck than a leading man, age (he's 74) has given him license to play his essential weirdness.
Guess what the top two success drivers were from his detailed research: a unique, superior, differentiated product; strong market orientation and voice of the customer built in. Guess what the top two deficiencies were: lack of market orientation; poor quality of execution.
Have you ever said “abracadabra”, “hocus pocus”, or “presto chango”? Well, guess what? You were casting a spell!
Yesterday evening at 6:30 P.M. there's a new charge nurse, he's going to give me my seizure medication and guess what? There isn't any!
Yesterday spears were the weapon of choice in the North Rift; today they are being replaced by the Kalashnikov and rocket-fired grenade.
‘She’s a dark horse,’ he said. ‘She knows just as much about climbing mountains as you or I. In fact, she was ahead of me the whole time, and I lost her.’
Once the cyst is diagnosed, surgical excision is the treatment of choice.
As she pulled the door closed behind her, she heard the nurse say, “Well! You’re a dark horse, I must say! Do you know that extraordinary-looking girl?”
Small wonder that I am restless. I think, and think, and I cannot cease from thinking.
“Well!” Genevieve laughs – the kind of bright, trilling laugh you give when you’re really quite annoyed about something. “Ed, you are a dark horse! I had no idea you had a girlfriend!”
That she was beautiful and intelligent could not be denied, and so it was small wonder that she might appeal strongly to any man.
Small wonder the average cost of new pools has leaped past $30,000.
We'll be able to sail safely across the bay once the storm dies down.
To continue haggling over points on which a consensus seems impossible, Lehman said, is to "just keep kicking the can down the road."
By the morning the fire had died down.
[ … ] one might easily despair and kick the can down the road by waiting for the next generation of computers and physical and chemical probes that can be employed for in situ measurements of chemical processes before starting to implement the research program described.
It could not have more obvious that ATC was urgently needed - yet all the new Labour Government did was make vague promises of reviews and 'consideration'. It kicked the can down the road, as did subsequent governments.
"I think you should consider your responsibility," said one critic. "How many patients went off the medications due to that publication, without consulting their doctor?", When the applause after this question died down, Deacon defended the right of scientists to question popular medications: [ … ]
The co-pilot didn't feel free to speak up to the pilot in the cockpit.
Sex in those days was regarded not so much as a playful sport, horizontal jogging it might be, as an unspeakable obsession needing pseudo-new assistance, the sin that dare not speak its name except in obscure, allusive, Latinate verbiage.
Yes, I understand that the current expression is horizontal jogging, Minister.
We read the contract with a view to finding a way out of it.

After 10 minutes of running flat out, he was out of breath.
His menacing presence cast a chill over everyone.
I was already sliding and too dedicated to change my line and just went flat out completely off the course.
When antelope are running flat out, they resemble very rapidly departing dots; some say they can hit 60 mph.
I was half way down the strip when I heard a speedboat and ran flat out back to the landing spot.
She thought it was best to tell him she didn't love him flat out.
He was flat out furious when his car was stolen.
Suppose that Professor Turk has won a prestigious grant and wants to impress his hearer with this fact, without saying flat out that he won it.
If, on the other hand, you simply deny flat out that you can give a metaphysical account of the concept “woman,” on the grounds that women are not essentially like one another in any respect— a position that, it′s important to notice, entails a commitment to your thinking that the idea of giving such an account is at least coherent— then you leave yourself with a problem about how to justify a politics based on the oppression of women.
Sometimes an eagerly promoted product turns out to be a joke — and sometimes it′s just flat out dangerous to life, limb, or commerce.
The media (in all its forms) has been known to stoop to even lower levels by flat out abusing non-whites such as the Bulletin's little description of Patrick Bowman reported above and then the Referee's self-congratulatory note that Evans (the Balmain nigger ped) had found gainful employment (at which he was 'very handy' rather than competent or skilled) and had ceased to waste everybody's time with his running.
He will stop at nothing to destroy his enemies.
[T]he American League pennant did not shape up as much of a race. There were the Indians and the Yankees, front runners as usual.
The production manager brushed by me on the stairs. He seemed to be in a real hurry.
Hey, hot stuff, wanna dance?
Both teams think they're hot stuff this year.
He brushed aside all my objections and went ahead with the project, regardless.
The ease with which Stoke brushed aside their Israeli opponents bodes well for the return fixture in early November, when a win could could secure their passage to the last 32.

Now proper French tradition requires that when you eat the ortolan, you drape a napkin over your head and consume the bird in one bite, beak, bones and all.

Our brave Ottoman soldiers are not easily frightened by noise, owing to their splendid nerves—and this is a war of nerves, a war in which strong nerves mean victory.

14 of America's best chess players are wielding kings, queens and their chessboard servants in a silent but brutal war. . . . "It's a mental war, it's a war of nerves, of logic, or reasoning, of being a good fighter," said Walter Browne.
The work of Ude is intended for the higher ranks, and for people of fortune. We conceive the book and the cook to have been overrated. It is neither French nor English — neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring. For the rest, Lord Sefton, who was too much of a mere glutton, would have perverted the taste of any cook, however good, who had been long in his service.
I suggested that this was a mistake, particularly at a time of national crisis on the railways, because it opened the way for critics of the railway to make hay - which Institute of Economic Affairs Director Richard Wellings duly did in an anti-rail article in the Daily Telegraph.

Everybody knows now that Richard and Betsy go together.

Exercise and sweat often go together.
To highlight the inadequacy of such evidence, we propose what we call “the babysitter test” for future prosecution witnesses in death penalty cases. We suggest that, to send someone to the gurney or the electric chair on the word of one witness, the prosecutor must agree to hire that witness as a babysitter for her or his kids for one evening.
"We set out to create a remote that passes the babysitter test," says Klarke, director of marketing and development for Harmony remotes.
At the devices’ launch, the company claimed this ease of use would pass “the babysitter test” of making TVs and DVD players intuitive to use.
A retired academic was the author of a poison-pen letter campaign that brought 12 years of fear to a North Yorkshire village, a court was told yesterday. Dr James Forster . . . was alleged to have branded one villager a prostitute and sent the 13-year-old daughter of the parish clerk a copy of a pornographic magazine.

The schoolmen, or rather certain of the schoolmen—for nothing is much shallower than to speak of all those disputants as one school—defined woman, "a featherless biped vehemently addicted to jealousy."
The day Microsoft went public, Gates became an instant megamillionaire . . . . But it wasn't until July 17, 1995, that Forbes magazine named him the richest featherless biped on the planet.

This is Memory Lane—lonely and drear to some, pleasant and gay to others. ... It was New Year's day in the old town, the most hallowed of holidays on Memory Lane; the day when the wharf was deserted, for everyone, great and small, walked over the Lane, many even to the very end.
"How about a stroll down Memory Lane. Remember this?" He thrust a picture at me.
My "memory lane" is splotched with recollections that have not dimmed or faded in the last seventy-five years. They stand out clear and sharp, but they are splotches just the same. They have no beginning, nor do they trail off to an ending. They are just there like ink splotches on a white wall.
Yet for a time the nation was again placed between the democracy of the levellers and the despotism of the Stuarts, — between the hammer and the anvil.
Sigrid took a bittersweet trip down memory lane when Anne opened the carton of ornaments and lifted out a crumpled tinsel star. All at once she was three years old again and her father was holding her up in his strong arms to place that same star on the very top of their Christmas tree.
Would you like to go halves on the grocery bill?
Let's go halves on this big watermelon.
Molly sleeps this morning as her parents, per their promise, travel down memory lane from their just-delivered leather sofa. Tim and I have memory-goaders galore, including our album of wedding photos, two separate videotapes of the marriage ceremony, and some random 35-millimeter slides one or the other of us somehow managed to squeeze off that strange and signal day exactly one year and four days ago.
The truth about Pastor Straton is that he is perhaps the country's most persistent publicity hound. He has an insatiable appetite for newspaper notice.
A more straightforwardly nostalgic use of the family album is in oral history, which has used them as a device for family reconstitution and opening up memory lanes.
You didn't hear that? Am I hearing things?
It was there before. I think I'm seeing things.
I decide to take in one last trip for the day - and one very much down memory lane. Changing trains at Central, I board a Class 150 bound for Barry Island, where I have not been for 46 years.
They attempt to straddle all issues and, consequently, when a slip occurs, the result is foot-in-mouth disease.

"Look back, Peter," he said, "and you can get your last glimpse of your native soil. The black line that just shows under the sky is Sandy Hook."
Nawaz Sharif, two-time Prime Minister of Pakistan, had planned a triumphant return to his native soil nearly seven years after choosing exile.
He says I'm the only one, but my friends say he's playing the field.
What a strange idea—what a needless labor—to construct artificial ruins in Rome, the native soil of ruin!
I know you got charm and appeal / You always play the field / I'm crazy to think you're all mine
But ostriches in breeding season are relentlessly promiscuous, with both males and females seeking liaisons with multiple partners. No doubt they have their reasons. But from an evolutionary perspective, playing the field is a way to get diverse DNA into as many nests as possible and compensate for the fact that most nests fail.
But there was beauty in her, and an inner strength that would allow her to stand tall and accept last night's phone call.
Leeds were once more indebted to the exceptional Schmeichel for keeping them in it when he stood tall to parry away Alex Song's near-post drive only 23 seconds into the second half, before Robert Snodgrass produced a goal-saving tackle just as Arshavin was about to pull the trigger.

Tarzan on his part never lost an opportunity to show that he fully reciprocated his foster father's sentiments, and whenever he could safely annoy him or make faces at him or hurl insults upon him from the safety of his mother's arms, or the slender branches of the higher trees, he did so.
Now I was the one on the back foot. He liked me. "Really?" "I'd like to take you out when we're back in LA"

[A]ny project for renewal is subject to a wide variety of destabilizing forces, not least when elites seek to duck out from the commitments they themselves have made.
As he had grown older, he found that he had grown away from his people. Their interests and his were far removed. They had not kept pace with him, nor could they understand aught of the many strange and wonderful dreams that passed through the active brain of their human king. So limited was their vocabulary that Tarzan could not even talk with them of the many new truths, and the great fields of thought that his reading had opened up before his longing eyes, or make known ambitions which stirred his soul.
A £3½ million scheme to modify stations, track and signalling for the operation of ten- instead of eight-car trains on the South Eastern Division of the S.R. did no more than keep pace with the growth of peak-hour travel.
'It is well, then, that we should be frank,' said the other. 'We both think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it?'
I had lied to Paddock about him, and the whole thing looked desperately fishy. If I made a clean breast of it and told the police everything he had told me, they would simply laugh at me.
Instead, imagine that a software project manager approaches you and makes a clean breast of his uncertainty about your proposed project: "Look, there are unknowns here, and we have catalogued the following eleven of them."

Following an hour of graft that did not include too many glimpses of goal he casually wheeled away having finished David Beckham's inviting cross in the manner of a man totally at home in those kind of positions.
David Luiz and Terry challenged for headers and when the loose ball fell to Mata, his shot was blocked on the line by a bundle of bodies that included King, Assou-Ekotto and Terry. Referee Atkinson was swift to award the goal as Mata wheeled away in celebration - much to the disgust of the Spurs players.
Getting to the bottom of Selmes' thinking is not the easiest of tasks but what in essence he is doing is trading a mummy (as in King Tut) for a big daddy (as in Tennessee Williams).

It is in ‘auld lang syne’ that we who are dead find our full despotic kingdom at last—that oneness of sway that even the truest, sweetest love can never assure us of while living.

You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?
The drift was becoming prodigiously deep; landmarks were getting snowed out; the road and the fields were all one:
Miss Mae gave me the stink eye, just on general principle, when I came into the kitchen. She was so good at the stink eye that even if you hadn't done something wrong, you felt like you did.
The claim of Dr. Hodge that our standards sustain the view which he advocates, must be taken cum grano salis.
Perhaps the ascription of grammatical structure to Classical Chinese sentences must even more often be taken cum grano salis, with a pinch of salt.
No wonder, then, that against a background of surging aggressive prosperity, South Wales built up during the last half of the nineteenth century a local railway system of great density and complexity, in which almost every company competed with every other in its area, and in which working agreements, running powers and strategic junctions ran riot across the railway map.

The row started over who will run for parliament in a wealthy rightwing constituency on the left bank in Paris, a safe seat for Sarkozy's ruling UMP.

Your paper gains "notice" as an example of the use of English as it should not be written nor spoken. Wake up and smell the coffee.
A few years back, when a wife told her husband to "wake up and smell the coffee," it usually was said in utter derision. Now, when there is coffee to smell, she shouts it to him in supreme delight.
Wake up and smell the coffee, Dummy. You're a comfort station on a back-street detour. Send him on his way.
The lines had realised that they had better stop fighting each other, and stick together in the face of the onslaught from the motor buses that were making horse buses obsolete.
Dear God, was she going to look at everybody who owned a truck with this sort of suspicion? “Come on, Heskell. Wake up and smell the coffee. They've become the singles bars of the nineties.[ … ]”

Sjostrom's game is predicated on strong skating. He accelerates in a heartbeat with a lightning quick stride and changes direction smoothly.
One could argue, of course, that most comedies about the risqué misadventures of teenagers are actually pretty wholesome. Horny hits like American Pie and last year's Blockers are, at heart, sweet coming-of-age stories, secretly reassuring everyone that the kids are all right—that no matter how many f-bombs they drop, no matter how raunchy their MPAA-antagonizing hijinks get, they're really just fumbling their inexperienced way through normal rites of passage.
He seems like an average businessman, but deep down he's an overgrown kid with a necktie.

Many projects were planned and started, but none saw the light of day.
Then the shit really hit the fan.
McTeague had a vague idea that Marcus Schouler was stuck on his cousin Trina. They "kept company" a good deal.

[T]hese men are no more lost souls than we are—are, in fact, woven out of the same yarn and cut from the same cloth.
Well, we've been at this bar for two hours; let's blow this popsicle stand and go to the nightclub.
Kremlinologists and Vaticanisti are cut from the same cloth — fantastically adept at identifying the most important signs amid the smoke-and-mirrors maneuvering of their respective subjects.
Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.

"Well, I never did!" she exclaimed in a scandalized whisper. "Trying to set fire to the 'ouse -- oh, fie".
He was always trying to make time with Nancy, but she just wasn't interested.
Their plans to finish the garden that weekend hit a snag when an unseasonal snowfall dropped several inches on what should have become the pumpkin patch that day.
Environmental pollution and the overconsumption of nonreplenishable resources is the boiling frog syndrome of the 21st century.
You can guess what the politicians said back then, too. "Don't worry," I'll bet they claimed, "tax rates will never rise!" It's the Boiling Frog Syndrome all over again.
When the colonel has given the signal for the music to beat time, he will give the caution for the movement as above; and the lieutenant colonel will immediately give the word to the right wing to mark time.
The boiling frog syndrome portrays how people react to change. Dramatic sudden changes instigate resistance and even anger in many individuals. Conversely, people do well at adjusting to slow change that occurs over a long period of time.
Next, they were ordered to converge on Bischofsburg. They had spent the morning marking time there.
Look at Facebook: Every company moved their brand presence to Facebook, sending out messages for their customers to receive. Now, you have to pay to send out your messages to people who chose to follow you. [You’ve become] a boiling frog.
The World Health Organisation’s latest data on air pollution proves there are more boiling frogs in India than anywhere else. People in 14 Indian cities are breathing the world’s most toxic air. Yet, like the metaphorical frogs who boil to death slowly without being aware of the danger, they are completely oblivious to the tragic fate that awaits them.
Our attractiveness as a location for investment is diminished. Unfortunately the pain is a boiling frog, as we can never know the investment and growth opportunities we will forsake.
But I believe I am justified in shutting the door on this vista of argument.
Let's shut the door on conflict.

A century ago you could expect to live 40 years. . . . Anything beyond that was borrowed time.
How fast was he going? A hundred and change. (i.e., more than 100 but less than 110).
The thing about borrowed time is that it always runs out quicker than you want it to.

TIME Justice Department correspondent Elaine Shannon is keeping her ear to the ground as candidates' names start to pop up.
How can you come up with such brilliant ideas?

Gore has looked into buying cable channel News World International. Despite initial reports, Gore's camp says he and his backers intend to make the channel not a liberal mouthpiece but a "hip" news channel. [ … ] Maybe; maybe not.

"You might as well set down," remarked Miss Hitty, with a new gentleness of manner. "I'm going to set a spell."
Hank's Hardware is one of those quintessentially American places. . . . Hank's is a place where people can set a spell, but it is also a business, competing in the ever-tightening hardware marketplace.
The traveller who expects to satisfy a champagne taste on a beer budget in this food-conscious city may be in for a disappointment.
The fact is the school system has spent itself into debt, at least partly by exhibiting a champagne taste on a beer budget.
. . . a sort of little back kitchen, where dirty work, such as washing up dishes, might be done.
[M]any a business-man can say he doesn't do dirty work, because he has others do it for him.
In a job like that you see the dirty work of Empire at close quarters. The wretched prisoners huddling in the stinking cages of the lock-ups, the grey, cowed faces of the long-term convicts, the scarred buttocks of the men who had been Bogged with bamboos – all these oppressed me with an intolerable sense of guilt.
You need to find the middle ground between the two extremes.
But musical ancestry aside, the influence to which [Justin] Bieber is most beholden is the current trends in pop music, which means Believe is loaded up with EDM accouterments, seeking a comfortable middle ground where Bieber’s impressively refined pop-R&B croon can rub up on techno blasts and garish dubstep drops (and occasionally grind on some AutoTune, not necessarily because it needs it, but because a certain amount of robo-voice is expected these days).
I was in the third year at school and I was sagging off with a few of my mates. We were on a building site and two of us got arrested and given a caution.
And you were academically bright, which I certainly had not expected, because Maggie told me how you were always sagging off school, only going in a couple of times a term to fetch books because you were an avid reader.

The investigators came up against a brick wall in their search for the missing money when they discovered it had been transferred overseas.
The effect of this downwards pull is to eliminate excessive twist and sagging off to leeward at the head of the sail and to allow a little more flow or belly near the luff.
They all ran up against the brick wall of high cost until the cryogenic option was proven feasible in 1973.

Hours before his climb down, the premier's own cabinet ministers had vigorously defended the curriculum.
No, but it may be a way for Clinton to climb down from a policy he seems increasingly to view as a no-win proposition.
If they are interested in climbing down from their oppositionism, Democrats ought to consult the Progressive Policy Institute, which has been critical of Bush, but which is developing a balanced, positive approach to the energy crisis.
Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering the display of. Esprit de corps. Well, what are you gaping at?
Long drinks generally have more mixer than alcohol and are often served with ice and a straw. The terms ‘straight up’ and ‘on the rocks’ are synonymous with the short drink, which tends to be more about the spirit, which is often combined with a single mixer, at most.

Altho' most of the planters were "land poor" and burdened by the heavy taxes of "Reconstruction," and altho' many Negroes, having abandoned hope of "forty acres and a mule" from the Federal Government, were now ready to buy ten acres and an ox, the sale of land to Negroes was generally reprobated.
Most ranchers are land poor—lots of land, but not much money.
[U]nless the murderer came back, I had till about six o'clock in the morning for my cogitations. I was in the soup — that was pretty clear.

From the time he was twenty-three he had all the leisure that a man could want, and as much money as he needed. A bachelor don in Trinity in the 1900's was comfortably off.
There are many ways of inviting a person to seat himself. The genial ‘take a pew’ of one's equal inspires confidence. The raucous ‘sit down in front’ of the frenzied pit, when you stand up to get a better view of the stage, is not so pleasant.
"Oh!" he said, looking round him with his chin a little in the air, "am I intruding, Turl?" . . . "Not at all, Berryman—take a pew!"

Then she started filling me in on background information that you could get from any press agent's dope sheet.
Karoulis's face twitched with a combination of fear and hope, wondering what news his Homicide Detective had for him. . . . "Name was Sten Doppleman. A known pusher, and a punk . . . . According to his dope sheet, he's a vicious son of a bitch."
The Bruins, seeking their third straight NCAA title, are picked on The Times dope sheet with 59 points.
Moreover, both the official cameramen and the newsreel cameramen were required to write a detailed ‘dope sheet’ describing each shot they had taken.
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?
From a workflow point of view, the access to these tools seems to have been guided by artists with experience with exposure sheets (a dope sheet for lip synch is included) and traditional animation.
Doing the opponents an obvious favor, the football coach decided to call off the dogs early after his team was up 56-0.
I did not know the exact route, but steered by the lay of the land, as I do in Boston.

"Now look here, Mary," he said, "I've been expecting you. I warn you before you begin that I cannot sanction your marriage to a Protestant." "Oh, but I'm going to convart him!" cried Mary so quickly that the priest laughed harder than ever. "So that's the lay of the land!" he chuckled. "Well, if you'll guarantee that, I'll give in."
She saw the boy's glance, she shifted her knees impatiently and her little face grew sullen. Hale smiled inwardly, for he thought he could already see the lay of the land, and he wondered that, at such an age, such fierceness could be.
Neil Armstrong made history in 1969 when he was the first person to walk on the Moon.
It seems like her boss feeds off her unhappiness.
He had the car pushed to a near-by stable. . . . "You were right," he said, when I met him out again in it, a week later. "It was gummed up, so to speak; but it's working like a charm to-day."
Erhard presumably felt it was no time to give his enemies grounds for charging him with gumming up relations with France.
I've got some time off next week, so maybe we could meet up then?
And for thy ill tongue, and worse practices, his lordship knows they are bred in the bone of thee.
The distinctiveness of Bellocchio's approach lay in his taking mental affliction, in this case epilepsy, and figuring it as symbolic of the self-immolating rage and frustration that the dysfunctional family breeds in the bone.
One principle ought to be bred in the bone of any European after the carnage of the 20th century: that no act of state bears such ominous consequences as changing a border by force.
He arrives at a time when jazz's discontented Young Turks have disdainfully turned away from their audiences and gone off to explore the way-out.
I says, "Pig Pen this here's the Rubber Duck and I'm about to put the hammer down."
Like a union is what some bearded beatniks and long-tressed girls are trying to form at Greenwich Village "Basket Houses." "Basket Houses" are coffee houses where they pass the basket to collect tips for the entertainers, who are not on the payroll.
Vince Martin showed up, Bob Gibson was expected, and all of a sudden the rogue's gallery of remember whens from the basket house days were all there.
Unlike many of the other clubs, it was not a so-called basket house, where walk-on performers of widely ranging competence earned only what they managed to collect in a basket they passed around the audience.
Don't you think I have anything better to do than go scrambling around hundreds of square miles of the toughest wilderness in the state looking for pie in the sky?
Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you / Just keep you crazy with nothing to do / Keep you occupied with pie in the sky
Instead of throwing it to center, however, she tried to make a grandstand play and threw it the entire length of the gymnasium to the waiting forward.
Every baseball fan is acquainted with the sarcastic reminder, "two hands are the fashion nowadays," often hurled at the infielder who foozles an attempt at a grandstand play in the form of a one-handed catch.
[M]ost Americans are chronically materialistic and optimistic, more interested in short-range than long-range prospects, and have been for many generations. Pie on the table today or, at the latest, tomorrow—apple pie, mince pie, pecan pie, apricot pie, coconut cream pie, lemon meringue pie, peach cobbler pie, blueberry, blackberry, huckleberry, and pizza pie—that is what they want, not "pie in the sky," whether the source of that promise be Christianity or Marxism.
Dag Hammarskjold and Russia's fellow Security Council members, bent on quieting the Congo turmoil, had watched the Soviets stir the fires of chaos, make a grandstand play to Africans by labeling the U.N. a partner to a colonial conspiracy.
[ … ] I grew in the House Full of Practical People, so any grand, dream-chasing pursuit has always struck me as sort of pie in the sky.
Ah, I can hear the objectors say, all this is pie in the sky and too expensive. In fact, according to Lord Burns, "this is all perfectly feasible at a reasonable cost".
Unless anything comes up, I'll be there every day this week.
Miss Moore was the toast of the town, and numerous were the advantageous opportunities of matrimony of which she was the recipient.
Newhouser was the toast of the town for his masterful, 11 to 0 shutout in which he struck out 10 batters.
And six minutes in they should have got off to a flying start. Aluko caused the damage. The winger slipped away from Ledley then stood up a cross to the back post which seemed perfect for Lee Wallace charging in.
"Come now, let's snap it up! Faster! Faster! Think fast! Let's go!"
He often took to the hills when his mother-in-law was in town.
The guests have been smiling for two and half hours and are so bored they're discussing their dental appointments. . . and everyone is anxiously facing the kitchen. . . . I summon my best friend, Mayva, who says, "You'd better snap it up."
Years of working under such noisy conditions ultimately left him stone deaf.
I was expecting the tearful ticking off, the girlish recriminations and all the rest of the bag of tricks along those lines.
But investigators have a hefty bag of tricks to expose them—powder, chemicals, lasers and lights.
Instead of to the credit side of my account he had put the whole bag of tricks to my debit.
The mirth and fun grew fast and furious;
The pace was fast and furious most of the time, with new high records of prices constantly being established.
The first reference was in 1862, stating: "The next day we had dog-races, and foot-races, and football, and the fun was fast and furious."
But in the 1970s the process went into reverse, as more and more 'bad' data went under the carpet.
The Bill is going to apply to a much wider group of people and I think it will sweep an awful lot of things under the carpet.
Conflict is brushed under the carpet.

Before you burn a disc — or, for that matter, every couple of days — running your computer's disk diagnostics program takes care of anything hiding under the rug.
There were things that have been on my back for years, acts that the little bird inside of me called my conscience would never let me forget, and that I wanted to brush under the rug, but the rug never seemed large enough.

The politicians seem to think that they have to hammer home every policy for the public to understand it: I would have thought we're more intelligent than that.
In ′86 Frank helped Ian nut out his first contract—$26,000 a year— [ … ] .
An inquiry takes place and more often than not all sides of politics — I should use ‘all’ rather than ‘both’ with the member for Cunningham sitting opposite — get together and nut out something, compromising a little bit here or there to come up with a final result.
In other situations, you might know someone who adds colour with personal anecdotes and feelings. You could shoot off a similar response – perhaps including a short story of your own to hammer home your point.
There was also the Black political pimp syndrome where a few middle-class and bourgeois negroes got big off the people′s struggles, and then nutted out completely, joining forces with our enemies, as agents, messengers, sophisticated stool pigeons, professional confusers.

We touched on the subject of wages, but we didn't reach a conclusion.
There is an elephant in the room that nearly every politician and green campaigner is ignoring. It’s called population growth.

Whether Bannon was sacked, resigned or left by mutual agreement – as usual with the Trump administration there are contradictory accounts – is immaterial.

Big hair went out of style as the 1980s came to a close.
In fine, his [Nathaniel Hawthorne's] golden touch is as unfailing as was that of Midas, and transmutes whatever he lays hand upon. … [H]e so transforms incidents and transactions of the most trivial character, as to render them grand, pathetic, or grotesque. … His golden touch, we would then say, imposes no superficial glitter, but brings out upon the surface, and concentrates into luminous points, the interior gilding, which is attached to the meanest objects and the lowliest scenes by their contact with the realm of sentiment, emotion, and spiritual life.
"He's something of a whiz-kid in City matters, you know. The golden touch, in a modest kind of way." He looked around his sitting-room, as if to say there were golden touches and golden touches.

Luckily for England, they have a world-class striker with a golden touch in [Harry] Kane, who was coolness personified to carefully direct in the winner.
Good morning, little Martin; rise and shine!
I remember dropping a brick when I first met her. As she at once started calling me 'Harry' in the way Americans are apt to do, the surname becoming immediately superfluous. I ventured to ask her what her Christian name was. ‘I'm not a Christian, Harry.’

I’m just saying that usually when you have a friend who’s a girl, it’s not just that she’s your friend. Either you’ve known her a long time, or she’s a friend with benefits.
Gender norms influence how young men orient themselves to sexual partners and girlfriends, and men’s procreative consciousness is sometimes affected by how they define a potential or actual sex partner (e.g., casual or serious girlfriend, “friend with benefits”, hookup).
Can I be so bold as to ask if I can be a friend with benefits?
Once you chew on it that way, you start thinking, jeez, maybe QAnon was almost inevitable.
The College Relationship is the hook up that turns into a “a person to hang out with,” more or less, a friend with benefits. This is a person whose company you sincerely enjoy, and you choose to spend extra time both hanging out and hooking up with, but there is no spoken commitment involved.

Ultrasuede minibags "are just the solution for waste." And for crime. Most minis hardly hold more than mad money and a comb.
"After the Lord Mayor's Show." Freddy looked up from reading Punch. "What is, old fruit?" "The excitement's gone. Back to dull monotony."
Such an expression is mad money, noted as early as 1922 by Howard J. Savage (Dialect Notes 5:148) at the end of an article on Bryn Mawr slang. Savage's definition is 'money a girl carries in case she has a row with her escort and wishes to go home alone.'

However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.

As his orgasm subsided, Tim slipped the head of his cock back into my mouth and I whimpered like a puppy, sucking greedily, enjoying the taste of his sperm bursting on my tongue.

Looking at it, serenely topping that crazy-quilt house, I had the impression of its being an outrageously squashed cherry topping, the whipped cream of as madly a concocted sundae that a soda jerk ever made. A pleasant impression.

This was a hardship in as much as inquiry showed that even in vegetarian restaurants many courses used to contain eggs.

Few Presidents have been bald. The last was Dwight D. Eisenhower. Luckily, he ran both times against another chrome dome, Adlai Stevenson.
Your idea that murder is the objective correlative of spiritual death, a metaphor for our daily lives, is fascinating. Is living on the edge thrilling and an interesting way to live?
"I like living on the edge," said Mr. Wertz, adding that, although winter fishing is far more dangerous, it is also more lucrative.
Any yet what we are talking about today is a threat to life, for 36 million very important Americans living on the margin so to speak, living on the edge, certainly, and living in wonderment as to whether or not they are going to be treated fairly in this process.

Genius is like that—great, simple, broad strokes!
However, every time you fail to do something, you make it harder to step up to the plate for the next challenge. Think of this ability and willingness to step up as a competency or skill that you can develop over time.

Nature's precious link between a squalid Past and a nobler Future, broken, snatched away from her allotted place in the long chain of the ages! Heiress of infinite hope, and dowered with latent fitness to fulfil her part, now so suddenly fallen by the wayside!
The boy and girl taking their cue from us also fail to put "first things first" and we find them falling by the wayside because our sense of relative values failed to function.
But…holy crickets. He's naked.
At this stage the learner tries to master the new tasks by the only means known—memorizing the rule for each kind of problem. This task being now impossible, even the outward appearance of progress ceases, and, with accompanying distress, another pupil falls by the wayside.
[D]ying dramatic arts like Kabuki and No (or Noh) that have existed for years … are falling by the wayside because of the onslaught of VCRs and the Hollywoodization of the dramatic arts.
Zooey, here's the deal. Peter's always been a girlfriend guy. He put all his focus and energy into his relationships, and all his dude friends just fell by the wayside.
Throughout the years, milk drinking has fallen by the wayside as soda drinking has gained in popularity.
Given the absence of an accepted government that unites Somalis behind it, the question of Somali nationality and identity falls by the wayside.
Planned orders for new trains fell by the wayside, justified amid passenger figures that had fallen back following the recession of the late 2000s (caused by the banking crash).
The Mister loved to be teased. He frequently asked for it by lying down and fanning the floor with his tail whilst eyeing you invitingly. We used to tease him about his black nose: called him "nigger nose".
We get such nicknames as nigger nose, beetle face, big lips, and this tends in a certain way to help gain the closeness of one to the other, but it also acts as a disruptive force in the room
The Zionists intended to shape the perceptions of a global public with limited interest in or understanding of the issues, filling in the blanks with their own narrative.
"Nigger — nigger nose!" She laughs. "Fix it? Please?" I don't want to cry. "Sure, nigger nose!"
It was important that she make something memorable. She wanted to be complimented. She wanted people to go home after the party and say, “Wasn't Dorothy's — fill in the blank — amazing?"
She called me nigger nose and 'nigger lips' and remarked on my buck teeth and lisp-y, effeminate voice.
He was on top of the world after she agreed to marry him.
You must try the chef's special: it's just out of this world.
And you asked Charles Briggs for the name of the man who bought the secret, and he gives you a legend. A man who might not even exist. You know what, this is a snipe hunt.
This promenading was chiefly patronised by the marines, and particularly by Colbrook, a remarkably handsome and very gentlemanly corporal among them. He was a complete lady's man; with fine black eyes, bright red cheeks, glossy jet whiskers, and a refined organisation of the whole man.
You know, Karen, I may not look much like a lady's man, but many a gal has cried when I left.
Oh the gals won't leave me alone / I have to disconnect my phone / That's how it is when you're a lady's man
The prosperous business owner whose infant daughter had a serious genetic disease decided to find a foundation whose annual report was less based on guilt trips. She appreciated that another foundation's annual report had much more emphasis on what they were able to accomplish with the money her family donated.
The fund raisers were criticized for too much of their appeal to donors being a guilt trip about how there would be more starving feral kittens unless donors significantly increased their donations.
He still resented his grandmother laying a guilt trip on him about starving children in China when he didn't finish her home-grown cabbage that he detested.
Andy Carroll is leading the line, with Suarez playing behind him.
Martial, who had been an injury doubt, led the line with strength and positivity.
Nothing went well in high school, so he dropped out.
After all this time, the little girl who watched her father get beheaded, who was captured and impressed as her enemy’s servant, who was captured again and taken to the site of her family’s massacre, who enrolled at assassin school, who went blind, who dropped out to pursue vengeance, the woman who endured all that by focusing on her hit list can be swayed from her course by the prospect of her family and her home.
After two glasses of whiskey, Tom soon dropped off in front of the television.
And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long.
I'll drop off your books when I see you tonight.
Was it a dominating performance? No. Were you expecting dominance? Fact is, Sounders FC created more than twice the chances of the home team. While the finishing was sub-par, the run of play was controlled by the guys in green until the unfortunate mistakes.
After dropping off travellers at Foregate Street, my train terminates at Shrub Hill - a station which boasts one of the best selection [sic] of semaphore signals left in the country.
As for the guides, they were debarred from the pleasure of discourse, the one being placed in the van, and the other obliged to bring up the rear.
Well, your mother has got three windows into my dancing room, and you have three into my garret.
Theſe are the Crimes of which we are guilty, before any Law to prohibit us: it were more allowable to plant Poiſon than to Manufacture with us, and we lie, it ſeems, under ſuch an Obloquy and Clamour, (which, as far as I can judge by your Letter, you alſo liſten to) that, as to import our Cattle to you is a Nuſance, and to export our Wools is Felony ; ſo, by Gradation, to erect here a Manufacture ought to be no leſs than Treaſon. And yet there is more Cry than Wool in all this Matter : For I dare, and do aſſure you, that, modeſtly ſpeaking the whole Quantity of what we work up in Ireland, amounts not to the Half of what any one Clothing-County in England does.
In rebuttal, the petitioner offers more cry than wool. He points first to the vague threats that his family and friends relayed to him during his 1990 return to El Salvador, and speculates that members of the FMLN still sought to harm him at that time. This is unabashed surmise.
When I found out he wrecked my brand-new car, I hit the roof.
He pointed out the little brown bird in the tree.
She pointed out the two drummers in the class.

Users also report that crystal heightens sexual arousal and increases stamina by delaying orgasm, and they report highly intense orgasms. However, after long-term use, the urge to ejaculate becomes all-comsuming. Impotence is a long-term consequence, and users develop “crystal dick,” which is the inability to have an erection.
The impotence drug finally gave meth users a way around "crystal dick," the erectile dysfunction typical with crystal.
It looks like everyone and his mother has come out tonight.
Anyone and his mother could see through that disguise.
We were jogging slowly in the park when, just like that, she collapsed.
On Thursday the same remark would have applied equally to Tokomairiro; everybody and his mother seemed to be paying us a visit.
Today I took your packed lunch to work by mistake.

We kicked on to a few more bars, having a good time, until a group of drunk American businessmen called us “oil trash” and shoved Erwin. We were not dressed like oil trash, we didn't draw attention to ourselves or look for trouble.
Never called anybody “oil trash.” Never had a bad word for anybody.
You're new here, so let me lay it down for you. I run a pretty tight ship around here. That's why the students call me "the hammer".

This complicated situation means that strategically managing services through the central Manchester area and beyond is not possible for signallers in the Greater Manchester area, and trains are invariably dealt with on a first come, first served basis.
Two cheers for that, at best. The original six party talks ran, or rather crawled, from 2003 to 2008. It remains unclear if North Korea was ever serious – or just playing for time while working on HEU.
The performance was a sign of real intent for Arsenal as they continue their pursuit for silverware on four fronts - and with Van Persie firing on all cylinders, the odds look good on them winning a first trophy since 2005.
In warfare, whoever opens fire first has a greater chance of victory.
The old lady nodded off to sleep many times during the narration, only waking up when George paused, saying it was most interesting.
I dragged him to the house, And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. I tried to make him talk about his travels. Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.
All patients struggle against daytime drowsiness and nod off at inopportune moments.
She swiped at her tears with the palm of her hand, slipped his front-door key into the breast pocket of his leather suit jacket, whispered to the dead man, “Bite me, asshole.”

Bugger off! You are joking, aren't you?
Everybody and their dog in that town had the "fever and ague," and they walked about like ghosts.
We tried to catch him, but he had already buggered off.
They also had important connections to advocacy groups and the local "grass tops."
And for all the chuntering about the "Granny Tax" it is not as though Osborne made a radical or, if you prefer, modest proposal along the lines of offering tax credits or generous allowances to the heirs of pensioners who plump for voluntary, patriotic euthanasia...
"I have a modest proposal," Alabaster said. "We need two new examples to demonstrate how awesome nuclear war is, so it will sober up politicians, military men and statesmen, not only here but in the Soviet Union."
She had already eaten a large lunch, to say nothing of a full cooked breakfast that morning.
The prodigies of this reign can scarce be paralelled in any reign. To say nothing of the King's sister the Dutchess of Orleance being poysoned, nor what was the occasion of it: to say nothing of the Queen Mother and Prince Rupert's leaving the Court in discontent: to say nothing of the thousands that dyed of the plague: to say nothing of the conflagration of London, [ … ]
Today more than 2.5 trillion images are shared or stored on the Internet annually—to say nothing of the billions more photographs and videos people keep to themselves.
A famous champion, he; super-expert in the art of "manning down" his opponent, and sometimes in the heat of battle glowing with such an ardour of excitement that he would make wide jumps, quite against every rule, and sweep off pieces wholesale.
Lots of people tried to cash in on that market, but few succeeded.
He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess; / And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request." ¶ Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan: / "It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone. / Yet 'tain't being dead — it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains; / So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."
It is also letting them probe the genomes of other organisms for DNA that could turn out to be a mother lode for medicine.

To end this class warfare is the conscious aim of the Socialist movement.
There's been a marked increase lately in Limbaugh's rhetoric about, of all things, class warfare.
The second reason his disliking of objects seems implausible is that I'm interviewing him in his Victorian terrace house in Islington – and it is packed to the rafters, often rather beautifully, with everything from Memphis glass to mid-century Aalto furniture to William Morris prints to Picasso plates...
To win the competition he has to beat his personal best, and he's going for it.
He really went for it.
Mr. Wallace, although fortified with a letter bearing the mitred seal of the Bishop the diocese, feels that he is about to come in contact with a great power; an awful something that is not to be trifled with; one of the noblest institutions of our land, who is a very Miller of Dee, and accountable to nobody.
Go for it! You can win this!
"None at all? No parents, no wives, no children of your own?" "Not one, thank God. Miller of Dee, that's me."
Stop playing computer games, and get busy with your homework.
The couple were getting busy in the front room when the doorbell rang.
Homer and Marge have to try to explain things to children who are too worldly to fall for most excuses, the explanation trails off, and what could be a pleasant family outing to solve it all turns out to be yet another excuse for self-involvement when one public humiliation doesn’t outweigh the joys of getting busy in a windmill.
Alyx Vance: Did Dr. Kleiner just say to everyone that they should get busy?
Thurl: Are you busy?, Alexia: Really? The days pass like decades in here, Thurl. We won't be busy until that worldship decides to talk back to us., Thurl: And yet, you have been…, Alexia: Thurl. If you say "getting busy" I will punch you so hard you'll have to spawn child processes just to feel all the pain.

It's inevitable that anything that provides us with such incredible amounts of pleasure and satisfaction is bound to serve up an equal amount of stress.
With only two fit centre-backs available, Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp employed young midfielder Jake Livermore at the back alongside Sebastien Bassong but Spurs struggled against a seasoned Champions League outfit, who beat Barcelona at the Nou Camp in 2009-10 and continually worked their way between the home defence to create some golden opportunities.
Just after the half-hour mark, the contest sprung to life with a frantic passage of play, Lampard's first-time ball releasing Drogba, whose slight hesitation allowed Gael Givet to produce a brilliant saving tackle.
He had been well aware ever since his coming to Hathelsborough of an atmosphere of intrigue and mystery; every development that occurred seemed to thicken it. . . . It puzzled him, being still a stranger to the habits and customs of these people, to see that life in Hathelsborough went on, amidst all these alarums and excursions.

He wrote a polite retraction, as an apology of sorts for his harsh words.
"Why—why, we sort of expected he'd be here!" says she.
Nothing was too small to receive attention, if a supervising eye could suggest improvements likely to conduce to the common welfare. Mr. Gordon Burnage, for instance, personally visited dust-bins and back premises, accompanied by a sort of village bailiff, going his round like a commanding officer doing billets.
‘I understand that the district was considered a sort of sanctuary,’ the Chief was saying. ‘An Alsatia like the ancient one behind the Strand, or the Saffron Hill before the First World War. […]’
She is known the world over as the woman who discovered it.
"That's a fine kettle of fish," he exclaimed, then turned to his dinner companion. "Fine kettle of fish. I'm so hungry even that sounds good, and from the looks of this menu that's probably what I'll get."
That is another kettle of fish entirely.
Mr. Burns is similarly perfectly cast as a heartless capitalist willing to do anything for a quick buck, even if it means endangering the lives of those around him and Marge elegantly rounds out the main cast as a good, pure-hearted and overly indulgent woman who sees the big, good heart (literally and metaphorically) of a monstrous man-brute.
My boss is a real piece of work, but my kids make keeping this job a necessary evil.
[H]ow was I supposed to know Dan Marino would shit the bed and lose that game by nineteen points?
“We're almost ready. If the damn copier doesn't shit the bed, that is.”
It created a disruption, and then some.
“Space travel isn’t a tax-free holiday for the wealthy,” said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon. “We pay taxes on plane tickets. Billionaires flying into space — producing no scientific value — should do the same, and then some!”
The 9/11 attacks weren't very good for America. / To say the least!
His performance, to say the least, didn't impress me.
Since the falling out with his neighbor, they have kept their distance.
To behold him, mounted on his old shelty, was truly a laughable scene, the animal being always so lean — a perfect "rickle o' banes," [ … ]
I am trusting to a fault.
He also had that good qualification, of a moderate expectation, almost to a fault.
These mosquitoes . . . are feeble, insignificant in size, diffident to a fault.
The Rev. William A. (Billy) Sunday, one of the most noted evangelists of the old "sawdust trail," died suddenly tonight of a heart attack in the home of his brother-in-law, William J. Thompson, a florist.
Mr. Bernstein explained that this was not obligatory. All he meant was that the suit was good enough to be married in, or for that matter to be buried in. "Or to be born anew in when Billy Sunday comes to town and I hit the sawdust trail," suggested the purchaser.
Fitz-Roy's character was a singular one, with very many noble features: he was devoted to his duty, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and indomitably energetic.
Madam, I'm as gentle as a jellyfish, and peaceful to a fault.
Self-deprecating to a fault, he refuses any praise for his work.
Further, some investors ride the coattails of investor giants, such as Warren Buffett, meaning they would frequently invest in the stocks Buffet invested in.
Ducklings and chicks grow at a phenomenal rate, consuming a huge amount of food. And what goes in, must come out. [ … ] They are pecking, peeping poop factories.
There's a fine line between fishing and just standing on the shore like an idiot.
Hey, watch it! You nearly hit me.
Playing telephone tag with your doctor is one of the most common—and frustrating—rituals of modern medicine. You phone...can't get past the receptionist...leave a message. Your doctor calls back while you're in a meeting...leaves a message. The amount of time wasted on both sides turns everybody sour.
[S]ome people . . . have been so short-sighted and reckless as to clamor for an easy dissolution of the marriage-contract. . . . Is it possible that they do not see that this is a liberty which, once granted, would always tell against the weaker sex?
[H]ard as he worked, his age was beginning to tell against him.
She knew he was disposed to catch at anything that seemed to tell against Godwin's claims.
[T]he comma tells against this reading.
He projects his concern to all employees and he means business when he says the “buck stops here”.
Repeated incidents of air rage have led to stricter security on airplanes.
This project is going nowhere.
Parliament, dominated by supporters of the government, voted on Thursday to delay making a decision on whether it will amend the constitution. The decision angered protesters and opposition parliamentarians, who accused parliament of trying to buy time.
His many charitable donations are beside the point. They do not make up for the fact that he stole the money to begin with.
This is not your father's computer programmer. The days when the typical information technology professional sat in a cubicle all day hunched over a keyboard, a can of Jolt Cola and a half-eaten Twinkie within arm's reach, seem about as quaint now as a genuine whistle-stop political campaign in the mass media age.
Just as this isn't your father's army — it's also not your father's VA. The bureaucracy is bigger, the forms have multiplied, the benefits have become more complicated.

Nevertheless, if a man has the salesman's qualifications, a little scientific study of salesmanship will sandpaper him, buff out his inequalities and make him a better man.
Like everybody I've met, he spoke exquisite English, right down to the American syntax, as if he wanted to buff out his German cultural ties. That's common too.

Marcia’s father, known in his neighborhood as “Duke,” became quite a gambler, betting on horses, dogs, boxing matches, and even policy, or “playing the numbers,” which was the ghetto lottery, so to speak.

The size of his victory . . . contradicted the maxim of latter-day fellow Californian Leo Durocher, who once said positively: "Nice guys finish last."

His sharp eyes scanned the faces of his charges. "Listen up!" he barked.
Now, residents' legendary 100+-hour workweek may be on its way out. . . . Some doctors insist the long hours are a necessary trial by fire that produces highly skilled, virtually unflappable physicians.

A night when you strip off and sit down to gasp and pant for a breath of air; such a night is never experienced in Kansas.
The U-boats, for instance, had a stranglehold on the merchant shipping supplying Britain, and it was thought that a convoy system would turn into a turkey shoot.
I cannot remember whose idea it was that we should strip off to our underclothing and go into the coolness of the stream.
Their exit from the tournament, without a set between them yesterday, at least demonstrated that the women's game is not quite the turkey shoot it might have seemed.
The other recruits started to undress where they stood but Ledanseur was too embarrassed to strip off in front of his new comrades. He went into the shower block and undressed there.
What may bar EastEnders from acceptance in the U.S. is not immorality but unintelligibility. PBS may even distribute a glossary of Cockney phrases so that Americans will know what a character means when he or she is "over the moon," "skint," "pipped to the post," or "in the club" (happy, broke, defeated, or pregnant).
They would never kick someone when they are down or give themselves an unfair advantage by cheating or stealing. The implications of this type of behavior are huge.

Bush's former Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, told tales out of school, prompting hot denials—and an investigation of whether he disclosed classified information.
If the wolf was to be feared, the learned gentleman might rest assured it would be the wolf in sheep's clothing, the masked pretender to patriotism. It was not from the fang of the lion, but from the tooth of the serpent, that reptile that insidiously steals upon the vitals of the constitution and gnaws it to the heart ere the mischief is suspected, that destruction was to be feared.
He's so in love, he doesn't know which end is up.
“I'll gladly take criticism from a cop who knows which end is up and isn't afraid to do the job the way it should be done.”
A deceitful man is a wolf in sheep's clothing. He will appear innocent, cheerful, polite, attentive, kind, obliging, and abjectly condescending; but let him once get you into his power and he becomes more ferocious, more cruel, and more destructive than the most savage animals that ever trod in deserts uninhabited by rational beings.
The whole company is in disarray! Nobody knows which end is up.
/mode/1up page 27: And if he preached other than the right doctrine, wherefore did his superiors in the Carthusian convent permit it? If the shepherds turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the flock, they should not blame the sheep for being worried.]
The poor devil was too clever by half, and made a big mistake for each of his strokes of genius.
Historians generally agree that Roosevelt was too clever by half, and that he miscalculated badly in assuming that he had the political muscle to alter the size of the Court.
[H]ere, then, was a community of good taste and kind feeling, no sharpers, no black-legs, no wolves in sheep's clothing.
So the tales were told ages before Æsop: and asses under lion's manes roared in Hebrew; and sly foxes flattered in Etruscan; and wolves in sheep's clothing gnashed their teeth in Sanscrit, no doubt.]
The larvae, it seemed, had "passed" as aphids. Like "wolves in sheep's clothing" they appeared to have fooled the guardians of their prey.
We'll be up the creek if we lose those files, so we should back them up regularly.
I couldn't bear to let you go yet So I threw caution to the wind And started listening to my longing heart And then you softly pressed your lips to mine And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed For such a long time.
The mother turned a blind eye to her son’s mischief as she expected him not to repeat it.
I’m a fan of Aaron Sorkin. . . . I just like the way his dialogue rolls off the tongue. I like to hear people say the words he writes.
In this my countrymen, without having produced any really very great work, by the old standards, make a respectable show. … In saying this, however, we must turn a blind eye to a considerable number of statues of our distinguished citizens which even more lamentably exhibit the defects arising from ignorance of modeling and design.
I have satisfied myself that she is alive, and apparently well, and hiding in plain sight. Prudence prevents me from saying where.
Her parents sought the official report on the incident, but they have run into a wall of silence.
German justice minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, said Monday that a Vatican secrecy rule has played a role in a "wall of silence" surrounding sexual abuse of children.
We've all heard of the Blue Wall of Silence, the code under which cops stay mum about rogue cops who poison the barrel.
The indictment of officer Michael Roberts also highlights another color barrier that can complicate matters of police discipline—that's the so-called blue wall of silence. Former Minneapolis police officer Mike Quinn says that wall is what keeps some cops from turning in their fellow cops.
They hit upon the idea of a site that would help users exchange video files.
I submitted my application for student finance months ago, but haven't heard back. I think I've fallen between the cracks.
A case sitting quietly in the Supreme Court’s in-basket promises to tell us more than almost any other about John G. Roberts Jr. and his evolution from spear carrier in the Reagan revolution to chief justice of the United States.
Reed was the preternaturally boyish spear carrier for the religious right, the brash Evangelical who transformed the Christian Coalition into a populist power center.
[T]he fugitive had been cajoled by a certain knight of the post, who undertook to manage the thousand pounds in such a manner, as would, in a very little time, make him perfectly independent [ … ] .
With his third novel he finally hit paydirt and wrote a bestseller.
Perhaps I can prevail upon him to change his mind.
The skipper Mr. Cooke had hired at Far Harbor was a God-fearing man with a luke warm interest in his new billet and employer, and had only been prevailed upon to take charge of the yacht after the offer of an emolument equal to half a year's sea pay of an ensign in the navy.
Michigan's Mackinac Island, the Lake Huron resort where automobiles are barred, was sprayed from stem to stern with DDT.
Pardon me for stepping on your foot.
Pardon me, but that is not true.
Pardon me, I didn't hear you.
From the ground, Colombo’s port does not look like much. Those entering it are greeted by wire fences, walls dating back to colonial times and security posts. For mariners leaving the port after lonely nights on the high seas, the delights of the B52 Night Club and Stallion Pub lie a stumble away.
[T]he debate is a sublime mismatch: He's expected to whip this guy, but good.
Dr. Gerald Bortolazzo, or Doc, as he is known, has some story to tell about a horse, his new career as a horseman and how he, if he did not exactly cheat death, fooled it but good.
“Do you often go looking for mice in other people's rooms?” “I wouldn't say often. Just when the spirit moves me, don't you know?” “I see. Well...” When people say “Well” to you like that, it usually means that they think you are outstaying your welcome and that the time has come to call it a day.

Reuters had scooped the pants off the U.S. press.
The Eden Project is his medium for getting that message across to the masses without boring the pants off them.
Not many people know it, but the Fuhrer was a terrific dancer. He could dance the pants off Churchhill.
Roosevelt not only remade America, but he also charmed the pants off everybody while he did it.
I know you are a good man at bottom.
At bottom I supposed that he had mistaken another book for mine.
As the New Year opened, the survival of Western democracy rested, at bottom, on the case the U.S. would make for it.
Last week the magazine's tenth annual rating of the nation's leading corporations showed that American business really went off to the races in 1963.
And with that, this tartly funny book is off to the races, inviting readers to tag along on a wild manic ride.
The university’s abandonment of its founding value of academic freedom in exchange for the corporation’s large financial contribution was a Faustian bargain.
I've made my Faustian bargain—for this woman, I've sold my immortal soul …
Rejuvenation was associated with a reinvigorated sex drive, and this connection generated an anxiety expressed in the Faustian bargain: damnation for a few extra years of carnal pleasure.
It has been remarked that all technology is a Faustian bargain: one obtains conveniences and sometimes luxuries, but in exchange one gets an increased potential for catastrophe.
But for decades, many executives actually employed sokaiya as muscle to keep unruly investors in check during their choreographed annual meetings. … Yet executives' reliance on mobsters turned out to be a Faustian bargain. By the 1970s, the sokaiya had figured out how to become stockholders themselves and threaten to ask embarrassing questions at annual meetings.
Don't burn out your biceps with 12-ounce curls.
"I suppose it's because I have credibility as someone with integrity and as a square shooter."
He'd always been aboveboard, a square shooter from start to finish.
And those lucky enough to be around him always knew who he was too — a gentleman of extraordinary character, a straight shooter and a pioneering journalist destined to be remembered.
A 1934 journalism graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Fleming, who has a reputation as an abrasive straight shooter, was a newspaper and magazine correspondent before joining ABC in 1957.
Keating . . . was an impatient taskmaster, but he was also a straight shooter who never held back a punch. . . . "Mitchell, you look like crap."
The UN General Assembly was expected to hold the line again today against seating Red China.
But the GOP lawmakers are happy to take home the news that they have held the line against deficit spending.
The transfer sounded prestigious, but it was definitely a demotion. This was the style of the Brezhnev Politburo: velvet handcuffs, but handcuffs nevertheless.
"Me, I just dropped in to hear yore big talk. Reminds me of old Geronimo. Like you, he gets all filled up with words about every so often and has to steam off. Go ahead, Gurley. Don't let me interrupt you. Make heap oration."
Classmates remembered him as brash and jug-eared and full of big talk about his sexual experience.
At the annual livestock convention in Toronto's Royal York Hotel last week, the big talk was about Holsteins.
"I would like to first of all commend all of the police officers today. . . . They were in fact at various times provoked, and they didn't take the bait in any way, shape or form."
"He wanted to have a discussion about creationism. . . . But I didn't want that sort of discussion, and when I didn't take the bait, I think I spoiled the script that had been running in his head."
He never, so far as I knew, gave me a bum steer.
Starring as a Great White Hope police commissioner sent to clean up Washington, D.C., Nelson displays a set of pipes barely hinted at in his years on "Coach," spending the long pilot hour barking, bloviating, singing(!) and generally chewing the scenery.
Johnston claims that Reuben Nelson and another tall negro were in New Haven the night of the escape and that they broke into the lockup. Johnson further states that the next day Nelson laughingly told him that the New Haven lockup was ‘a gravy train’.
Of course these foreigners want to come to America. […] To them America is the land of the free ride; and they want to climb aboard the gravy train, even though that means abandoning their friends and neighbors, the ashes of their fathers and the temples of their gods, to a struggle to which they themselves are no longer equal.
Hatcher derailed the gravy train by consolidating City Hall operations into five general departments headed by three special assistants and two members of the Board of Works.
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy? / We call it riding the gravy train
The display and result must be placed in the context that was it was against a side that looked every bit their Fifa world ranking of 141 - but England completed the job with efficiency to record their biggest away win in 19 years.
Freeloaders are a prime example of the people that will repeatedly burn you if they have the chance. […] They would much rather find someone with a generous nature, and ride that gravy train till the gravy runs out.
This whole gay marriage clamor is really about spousal and other benefits that this welfare state provider has made so enticing. It's only natural that everybody wants to get on a gravy train or ride a free horse.
Free medical and schooling for illegals; Citizenship for babies of illegals; Free schooling; Free language education. On and on goes the gravy train. Who wouldn't bust into this country for the easy life.
It is clear that dissent can no longer be tolerated, and no one is above using their position[…]to stifle thought that frightens them or threatens to upset the gravy train.
[…] This isn't so much the gravy train, but the express gravy train, and just like Eurostar, it runs a lot faster in Europe than in the UK.
Arsenal's dominance was reflected in a flurry of goals before half-time – three in six minutes: first, Podolski turned the screw with a peach of a free-kick; then Gervinho accelerated on to Mikel Arteta's beautifully crafted pass and beat Davis at his near post with conviction; and finally Southampton's defence unspooled completely when Gervinho broke to release Gibbs, whose return ball cannoned off Nathaniel Clyne for Southampton's second own goal of a sobering afternoon.
In this establishment, as everybody knows, on occasions when the crush is great, the animals rub shoulders freely with the spectators.
He just doesn't get the point that this is not a race.
It pays to network and rub shoulders virtually with potential customers on the Web.
[S]adness and poverty are never more intolerable than when hope and wealth rub elbows with them.
He just wanted to rub elbows with this throng of young people.
Those were all landmark moments to cherish. Just as appealing was the manner in which Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Milner cut swathes down either flank, albeit through flustered full-backs who had looked poorly positioned and horribly jittery from the start.
[I]t was her [Princess Charlotte of Prussia's] increasingly violent tantrums that caused her parents the greatest concern. Shortly before the child's second birthday we read, 'Ditta has such outbreaks of rage & stubbornness that she screams blue murder.'
I pull her [a car] back into third, boot her up to sixty and the outreach bungalows go to blur. The gearbox screams blue murder, but we're getting there, and the newspaper kid stops, turns on his BMX. He fades to a speck in the mirror until we are once again on our own, [ … ]
The first time he was offered a bottle, my boy screamed blue murder; the second time, he screamed blue murder; the third time, my husband fed him and he screamed blue murder; the fourth time, he drank it without a whimper.
"Oh," said Jimmy, "if I ever want any one to break into a safe, come to you, huh?" "You get me," replied the other. . . . "I should think," said Jimmy, "that a man of your ability could earn a living by less precarious methods." "You would think so," replied the Lizard. "I've tried two or three times to go straight. Wore out my shoes looking for a job."
He's proved very reliable since he was paroled. He's a good kid tryin' to go straight, for the most part.
Grand Opera mishaps are usually more silly than solemn, and provide people with amusing table talk.

No one else has achieved the right knit of polyester Dacron fibers—lots of mills have taken a run at it.
Dean told me that he understood he would have to grow as a candidate in order to succeed, that it was time to move his campaign beyond attacks and anger, to take a run at the vision thing.
Through Monday, Honolulu has set record highs 8 days straight and could again take a run at a record today.
Only one guy was brave enough to take a run at Tiger Woods at the British Open yesterday. . . . DiMarco finished two shots behind Woods.
I concur in the opinion of Justice Haning, but write separately to comment on the apparently widespread use of the term "Chinese Wall" to describe the type of screening mechanism discussed in this case. While our opinion uses the term "screen," both the parties and the trial court used the term "Chinese Wall," which seems to have become a term of art. I write to express my profound objection to the use of this phrase in this context.
The enthusiasm for handy phrases of verbal shorthand is understandable. Occasionally, however, lawyers and judges use a term which is singularly inappropriate. "Chinese Wall" is one such piece of legal flotsam which should be emphatically abandoned. The term has an ethnic focus which many would consider a subtle form of linguistic discrimination. Certainly, the continued use of the term would be insensitive to the ethnic identity of the many persons of Chinese descent.
Don't worry; the police have been called and the situation is under control.
So I explained in words of one syllable that I went there to pick edelweiss from the fire escapes.

He has suggested raising “sin taxes” on cigarettes, liquor and arcade games to pay for the 24-percent teacher pay raise he supports.
Now I am quite at a stand.
The sin tax is an established tactic. In the early 1500s, Pope Leo X underwrote his lavish lifestyle in part by taxing licensed prostitutes.

Some how or other my eye encountered with Miss Maria’s at the end of this speech; she seemed conscious, and on my observing that Mr. Wellworth was an excellent young man, she reddened excessively, and seemed at a stand for words.
The Air Force not only makes up words and phrases (e.g., brain bucket for crash helmet) . . . .
Roy Knickman of 7-Eleven said he fears more crashes today and will not keep his helmet far from sight. "I always wear my brain bucket," he said.
I began for the first time to falter, and was at a stand to know what course to pursue.
He asked me, had I heard any untoward news abroad? I replied instantly that I had not. Nothing of foreigners come into the neighbourhood? This put me rather at a stand.

“We've never seen a high-profile film—a film of this budget, a tentpole movie with this box office potential—leak in any form this early,” he said.
Variety is reporting that del Toro will direct the flick with Watson cast as its titular Beauty. . . . So we’re thinking big tentpole movie versus introverted indie.

They hoped to hire only the cream of the crop for the new project team.
If his word and image are consistently proven to be false, he doesn't have a leg to stand on.
[S]ome spirits, more audacious than the rest, became restive under the slow march of events.
For three decades, John Howard has been on a slow march to end centralized wage-fixing.
Codd said . . . when he had her fixed and tested her a few times he would take me up for a ride. "You got the wrong number," I says. "I don't feel flighty."
The readers probably expecting me to go on about how Johnny was real nostalgic about some kind of material security. . . . Well, the readers got the wrong number.
His musical system, like the political system he served, would rescue the present moment from crisis and place it at last in productive harmony with history's demands. Boy, did he have the wrong number.
After years of chewing on murder mysteries as my form of “brain candy,” I thought I'd sample westerns for a change of pace.

Jane went on the pill when she left for college.
Our eyes met. Plain and simple we were having eye sex. If his eyes were a pool I could've drowned in them, sunk to the bottom never to come up for air.
We played it again and I watched as the bride danced with her new husband but had eye sex with Tommy from across the room.
However, if he ups the ante to three or more servings of alcohol, he not only puts his heart at risk, but he puts himself at risk of getting whiskey dick and not being able to perform in the sack.
The old version was okay, but the new version blows chunks.
It is held to be a good taunt, and somehow or other to clinch the question logically, when an old gentleman waggles his head and says: "Ah, so I thought when I was your age." It is not thought an answer at all, if the young man retorts: "My venerable sir, so I shall most probably think when I am yours." And yet the one is as good as the other: pass for pass, tit for tat, a Roland for an Oliver.

“It would be most irregular Grandpa!” says Miss Cecily frowning and tapping her foot. “Well, we’re a pretty irregular family so that’s neither here nor there,” says the old man, impish like.
As a sociologist, Raper concerned himself with everything from the legal impediments African Americans faced to the way blacks and whites arranged themselves around the hot stove in a small-town general store. He was among the first generation of southern public intellectuals, an engaged academic in a region where anti-intellectualism had a long and healthy tradition.
After years of teaching 18th century British literature, in 1975 he crossed from academic to public intellectual with The Great War and Modern Memory, a seminal book examining how World War I, by its scope and immense carnage, caused a disillusionment that plagued Western society for decades.
I tried reading the instruction manual but many of the steps were unfortunately lost in translation.

The young men made their preparations with alacrity, and, headed by this western patriarch, we proceeded at a rapid gait to surprize the tenants of this den of iniquity.
"Shet up!" I snarled. "I'm jest payin' yuh back for all the pain and humiliation I suffered in this den of iniquity--"
Matthew, sceptic and scoffer, had already failed to subscribe a prompt belief in that pain about the heart: he had muttered some words, amongst which the phrase "shamming Abraham" had been very distinctly audible.
"You think you're set. You think everything's taken care of. I thought I had the world by the tail."
He grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, but he made a success of himself.
WITH THE THUNDER of boots setting the stage, a group of hard-riding horsemen burses into view. This is not a new oat opera on TV, but a group which combines love of 4-H with love of horses--the Perry County Boots and Saddle 4-H Club.
A queasy combination of classic Wayne oat opera and happy jalopy jokiness a la Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
“Can you come over to the wrong side of the tracks?” she asked, an amused dryness underscoring the delivery of that question. “Always.” “I was, of course, referring to geographical matters. You live in the more chic part of Kreuzberg.”
Leroy Robert Page (the change in spelling of the last name is a story in itself) was born on the wrong side of the tracks in a hostile South that had long ago defined him and his kind as just another “throwaway nigger.”
The government has no other option than to rein in public spending.
Inside the Bible's cover is pasted a bookseller's label identifying the article: “A Smuggler's Bible. Used by smugglers on both sides of the Atlantic in the early nineteenth century to conceal small objects of value. Actually a mere box, this ‘Bible’ could be used to contain any assortment of goods the smuggler could get into it. ca. 1820 (?)”
A ‘smuggler's bible’ is a facsimile of the sacred book which contains nothing but can carry anything.

A 72-year-old "bed blocker" was yesterday ordered to vacate the hospital bed he has refused to leave for three years, despite being in good health.

[E]xhausted negotiators pored over maps and drafts of a proposed agreement in smoke-filled Cairo hotel rooms, until the morning of the third day, when Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres proclaimed that the two sides had "reached a meeting of the minds."
Mr. Noda met with Mr. Ozawa twice but the talks failed to yield a meeting of the minds.
"You still think they come all boxed, sorted, and labeled, do you?" he said. "And that they aren't ‘just folks’ at all?" "Yes, I still think so. They never seem a bit like ‘folks’ to me. It's their business to sit up there stiff and solemn and stern."
He was happy . . . to be going out to a restaurant without having to sign books or talk to students about Whitman and Melville. . . . Idolized Bech loved, at the end of a long day impersonating himself, being just folks.

Instead of using the opportunity to ease the tensions between Bonn and Washington, Acheson chose to pour gasoline on the fire.
The Ayatollah Khomeini poured gasoline on the fire with his comments on the mosque seizure, which were broadcast by Iranian radio the day after the attack.
We have been jinxed with a vengeance. Some one has held the Indian sign on us for sure.
Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart): Nah, I've got the Indian sign on me. It seems I can't win.

The apartment seemed like good value until we factored in the cost of the repairs.
In addition to employment in the area, once you factor in the patronage of people visiting the various sites, it's not difficult to see why it's being redeveloped. The current station building is tiny in comparison to other stations with a similar patronage.
In essence, the book gives a step-by-step account of how the author built, modified and developed his own 6-inch Newtonian reflector, pressing into service such materials as old larder shelves, a car halfshaft, pieces of Meccano, and several coffee-jar tops.
The chances are that you have nearly everything you need to start up your business already somewhere around your home.

"Sollozzo is coming to us for help," Hagen said. . . . "For that we get a piece of the action."
The British and French, who had sought to make policy by reviving 19th century gunboat diplomacy, had temporarily lost their credentials for world statesmanship.
There are two ways to get a piece of the action at any of the big drug markets along the border: pay off—or kill off—anyone who stands in your way.
China has ratcheted up its standard gunboat diplomacy—the repeated warnings that it would use force if necessary to unite the island and mainland—more than a month before Taiwanese voters go to the polls.
Despite already being aware, he will be acting out the pretence of a surprise.
They threw the kitchen sink at the problem, but still they couldn't fix it.
Andy quoted one of the trainers (or facilitators, as they like to be called), whose job it is to instill " sensitivity " about age, race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, and the kitchen sink into employees of Washington businesses:
I think the most vulnerable stocks, as I understand it, in this situation are the what we call business-to-consumer Internet commerce stocks, selling everything from cars to kitchen sinks on the Internet.
How good are you at packing a car's trunk? Decide how big a challenge you want, then choose your cards to find out which of the crazy items - everything from a spare tire to the kitchen sink - you need to cram in.
Well, I'll be bound!! Another example of following the rules and being undercut on pricing by those who don't follow the regs.

In simple terms, both superpowers poured gasoline on the fire and fanned the flames, hoping that out of the ashes would arise a region committed either to democracy or to Soviet-style communism.
They worried, too, that such a war would only fan the flames of the Islamic world's animosity toward the United States, producing "a further cycle of terrorist attacks, American casualties and escalation" [ … ]
Atlanta newspapers fanned the flames of racial hatred by carrying stories of lynchings and calling for a renewed Ku Klux Klan to “control” blacks.

Seth Diamond, commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services, drew a line between evacuees and the “traditional homeless,” arguing that court-ordered rules on shelter standards do not apply to short-term shelter from a natural disaster.
They're gaining on you; you'd better hit the gas, now!

Indeed, part of the problem was that Armstrong was rowing back on so much previous behaviour and years of aggressive lambasting of reporters, officials and team-mates who had claimed he was doping.

I distinguish five more general classes: but I am far from equally happy about all of them. They are, however, quite enough to play Old Harry with two fetishes which I admit to an inclination to play Old Harry with, viz. (1) the true/false fetish, (2) the value/fact fetish.'

Still fresh in my mind was the 15-pound striped bass that took me on a miniature Nantucket sleigh ride around Sandy Hook Bay last fall.
As a ploy to discredit the reformist politician, the opposing party had hired a lookalike to act as his evil twin and be seen in a variety of compromising situations.
He’s a willing little beast, and not unlikely to romp home in the lead. I’d bet on him myself, except that I’m so damnably unlucky that it really wouldn’t be fair to you, Vane. I never back a horse but what he falls.
...we see the flip side, the evil twin, the dark side of addition. Human nature contains both a thing and its opposite in varying degrees of tension, and so for every plus there is a minus.

In light of the frequent kidnappings in Iraq, do you suppose someone could invent a small tracking device that could be woven onto clothing and hard to find on it so that when someone gets kidnapped, the tracking devices could pin down their location?
Hodgson's irritation about the booking that means Welbeck is suspended on Tuesday was there for everyone to see and justifiable, too, when it was such a soft decision.
The United Nations then became the one great attempt to establish a formal institution to unify the world, especially in light of the darkness that preceded it.

After all, if we think of the Vatican as a vast and hugely successful multinational corporation, then this interview would appear to be the equivalent of a profits warning. At the very least, it would seem to be tinkering with the formula of the biggest spiritual brand in the world, analogous to Coca-Cola changing its famous recipe in 1985.

“Here,” said Wigmore, “no bickering tonight, and no politics either. I’m off the chain, and we’re going to take you out to dinner at Oddy’s, and a theatre.”
although shop-assistants, among others, had to work longer hours, even up to 9 and 10 o’clock, for Saturday night became one of the busiest shopping times of the week, a sufficiently large number of people were “off the chain” by midday to give rise for the first time to the problem of what to do with leisure.
For ten years—from 1885 to 1895—this system continued unchanged, and in it there was no room for a holiday for me, a month, a fortnight, even a week off the chain; at the most a rare day. And relentlessly was I held on the chain.
Steward Niles Korbet, agrees: “I like my job better than any other job. Even if I wasn’t making B’s—’cause I'm off the chain.” The regularity of the chain is directly related to the workers’ complaints of monotony and tiring work; but the chain’s regularity is also related to the high bonus which the workers make.
The morose Ed Wilshot poured himself another drink and mumbled something about taking three weeks off the chain and heading south for some sunshine.

Solly had carried on the old business, and was making a big name for himself.

England have made heavy going of Group H but they have handled the pressures of their last two games admirably and playing at their own stadium no longer appears to fill with them with apprehension.
[T]hey believe that other radical propositions which the President is urging proceed from a very narrow demand, in fact, one not much larger than the desire of men like La Follette and Cummins to make personal capital out of their own radicalism.
I have always thought . . . that the real reason he retired from public life, though he was obviously the heir of Wilson and for long the first Democrat in the land, was that he could not bear the thought of making personal capital out of his career in the war.
I was so pleased I wanted to cry, for the children do love me, and run to me for everything now, and think the world of Sister.

You really fouled up this time.
Their fate remained in doubt until the very last game of the season. This truly was a team that captured lightning in a bottle.
We tracked down four people who introduced some of the most popular fad items of the past few decades to find out how they handled their sudden prosperity—and rapid exit from the limelight. Some were relaxing and enjoying their spoils. Others were trying to capture lightning in a bottle one more time.

[1794, February 25][ … ]While the French slaves were in a state of convulsion, it was very extraordinary to wish; by pouring in fresh slaves among them, to add fuel to the fire, and give them fresh reinforcements of mutineers; for such would the newly-imported slaves become.
But this had no effect, only to add fuel to the fire; so that, at last, both parties were so exasperated, that, had not the magistrates of Frankfort (who were now head of the English reformed church) interposed, they were on the point of coming to blows.
[ … ] and to admit women into active participation in politics will certainly be to increase disorder and add fuel to the fire of strife.

Remember the death of Wilson was fearfully avenged; and those yet live who can compel you to drink the dregs of your poisoned chalice.— …
You need not, therefore, be surprised to hear of the vigorous blockade of the Chesapeake and Hampton Roads, and of the ports of seceded States, and that if these States erect batteries at Memphis or Vicksburgh to intercept the commerce of the Mississippi, that measures of stern retaliation or resistance will be inaugurated by the Government, to force the poisoned chalice to the lips of those who first drugged it.
His [Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's] role last year in persuading Ayatollah [Ruhollah] Khomeini to agree a Gulf War ceasefire – a decision the imam likened "to drinking from a poisoned chalice" – enhanced his reputation for pragmatism.
It is why the question of whether Labour should have accepted the support of his [Rupert Murdoch's] media empire as a gift, or spurned it as a poisoned chalice, retains a certain relevance.

The Montgomery bus boycott was "saved by the bell" of a federal Supreme Court decision that came just before the last minute.
But in 1998, Mr. DiFrancesco never answered the allegations against him to the satisfaction of town officials. Instead, he was saved by the bell, in a way: In a rare electoral upset, Democrats took control of the Township Council in November 1998. They immediately fired Mr. DiFrancesco and replaced him with a Democrat, giving his termination the appearance of simple partisan politics.
"Stand from under," he shouted out, as he threw down a cocoa-nut, which very nearly hit Billy, who had not attended to his warning.

It is a curious fact that the telegraph clerks in England and America employ the letters ‘O. K.,’ when they send a telegram that a message has been received Oll Korrect.

In Ireland,a sort of birth tourism emerged in which non-EU nationals sought to give birth there to secure citizenship for their children and exemption from deportation for themselves
Wednesday to Shadow, "I don't sleep. It's overrated. A bad habit I do my best to avoid - in company, wherever possible, and the young lady may go off the boil if I don't get back to her."
The Harper government is considering changes to the citizenship rules to target so-called birth tourism — where a foreign national comes to Canada to give birth so the baby can get Canadian citizenship.
By then we'd gone off the boil sexually and he was even less keen than I was about 'marriedness', so it was more like friends deciding to share a flat than the setting-up of a ménage.
In a town where everybody plays the angles and wholesomeness is something of an aberration, Julie Andrews, 31, is tolerated as a delightful kook.
She told him that she was dangerous, that she couldn't be trusted, that all she wanted to do in her life was play the angles and stick it to anybody who gave her the opportunity.
For tax evaders and those playing the angles, a network of accountants, lawyers and bankers is ready to set up shell companies and phony trusts to hide behind.
He was clearly dealing with extremely small quantities, and considering the clumsy structure of telescopes then in use, it is surprising he managed to carry through the procedure at all. Nevertheless, he obtained a remarkably good value [ … ]

Timothy Mack has spent 13 years spiriting wallets from the pockets and purses of Los Angelenos, an artful dodger's career that has been interrupted by 20 arrests and two jail terms.
My objective was to carry the mail for the President, working with the Congress, forging that new bill.
The coaches will say, "We have two starters at running back," but the guy who'll carry the mail is DeMarco Murray.
With which intolerable pains if the party shriek or cry out, they roar out as loud to him to confess the truth, or else he shall come down with a vengeance.
Yes, egad, they are tenacious of reputation with a vengeance, for they don't choose anybody should have a character but themselves!
It is said, that in the first representation of the Furies of Eschylus, the horror of the spectacle was so great, that several women miscarried; which was indeed pathos with a vengeance.
They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
From the first, she is the New Woman with a vengeance, loving nothing better than a chair, whisky, cigars and a detective story.
Thou fool, I ne'er do things by halves, Farthings are made for Irish slaves; No brass for me, it must be gold, Or fifty pounds in silver told.
I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is not my nature. My attachments are always excessively strong.
She was too thoroughgoing to do things by halves.
They don't do things by halves in the States. Whether it is cars, burgers or waistlines, Americans like to think bigger.
If there was one word to describe her, it was "intense" - so well chosen in her brother Michael's moving eulogy. Nothing, absolutely nothing was done by halves. . . . Her commitment was total.
[A]fter a good deal of discussion (some of it angry) among the Major-Generals, it was settled as such things are everywhere—the willing horse (which SHERMAN always is) getting the work to do.
Finding us easy in our ways, he . . . told me a cock-and-bull story with the moral of another five francs for the narrator. The thing was palpably absurd; but I paid up, and at once dropped all friendliness of manner. . . . He saw in a moment that he had gone too far, and killed a willing horse.
There is certainly the need to reward performance and offer incentives for success, but flogging a willing horse is not the way to do it.
Your plan will tell you if your idea has legs and is viable.
Her daughter is such a cutie pie!
[I]t was enough to send her rattling away again in a cab, through deserts of gritty streets, where many people crowded at the corner of courts and byways to get some air.
Ah, I see! You went for a little walk to get some air!
"You'd better begin to get some air and exercise and quit hanging about in the house all day."
Gaza City had become generally calmer on Thursday after a cease-fire between Fatah and Hamas, and residents had emerged into the streets to buy food and get some air.
Ironically, this hesitation to condemn comes from a good place – the part of the British psyche that rightly prides itself on respecting other cultures.
That gushing, glowing, 2,500-word goodbye e-mail does come from a good place. That doesn't make it a good idea.
I wasn't expecting it to work, but I hit it big when I tried the new approach.

Germany huffed and switched angles and went wide, slinging in crosses, and finally sending on Der Targetman, Mario Gomez, for the last 11 minutes. To no avail, as Mexico held on for a sensational win against the defending champions.
[H]e had been engaged in divers hostile expeditions against the aborigines, and on all occasions had he shown a cool head and a resolute mind.
[Y]ou could not be indifferent to the war, you could not be of two minds about it. And yet—Jimmie Higgins was of two minds! He wanted to beat back the Huns, who had made all this fearful mess; but also he wanted to beat the profiteers who were making messes at home.
It requires a cool head, which Mr. Murray most assuredly has, as well as the ability to remain unruffled by bizarre apparitions.
I'm of two minds about Vegas. I think Vegas is strange, and I don't know where their water comes from. But as a town and a place for an entertainer, there's . . . no other place you can go to where you can just sit and do six weeks at a time and have your band and your staff be so happy.
His plan did not take into account the possibility of rain.
Folks, however, cannot (and, alas, more's the pity!) eat and drink, and dance and sing, for ever.
She was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much. But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have burned, there was a blank.
A day or two later we took down another seller and this time the rookie performs the search. Assume the position! he tells the guy. So the guy leans against the side of the car.
Parlay's a full-blooded Frenchman. . . . About a hundred miserable Paumotans lived on the island. He married the queen—native fashion. . . . Now before the queen died she gave birth to a girl. . . . She was educated like a princess, and she accepted herself in much the same way. Also, she thought she was all-white, and never dreamed of a bar sinister.
James Smithson was the illegitimate son of the first Duke of Northumberland, third creation. His mother was a lineal descendant of Henry VII. Despite so much blue blood, the bar sinister seared James Smithson all his life.
Then there is untouchability. . . . There are thousands of men and women like me who cling to Hinduism; because they believe that there is in it the amplest scope for mental, moral and spiritual expansion. This bar sinister put upon nearly sixty million human beings is a standing demonstration against that claim. Men like me feel that untouchability is no integral part of Hinduism. It is an excrescence.
We crawl over each other in our race for power, wealth, and fame.
By the time "The Contest" was repeated on April 29, 1993, the first night of that year's May sweeps, Seinfeld was a Top Ten show on Thursday nights, and advertisers were crawling over each other to sign up.
He went to the University of Kansas for almost two years before he dropped out.
Someone needs to repair that worn-out old bridge. It's an accident waiting to happen!
Maguire looked totally devoid of confidence, a lost soul and an accident waiting to happen, which it eventually did.
The other extreme is a cattle call audition, when dozens or even hundreds of performers are auditioned in groups, only getting a chance to speak a few lines, sing a few bars, or dance a few steps.
For most patients, the old-fashioned basal metabolism test is a mild form of torture . . . and four Navy researchers have come to the conclusion that in big medical centers with facilities for handling radioisotopes it should be replaced by the "atomic cocktail."
The test showed excessive hormone, so the doctor prescribed an “atomic cocktail,” a radioactive iodine mixture designed to partially kill the thyroid gland.
I was at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles for a radioactive iodine scan, this one at diagnostic levels—less radiation than the therapeutic levels I would eventually endure. I drank my first atomic cocktail: a vial of liquid radioactive iodine diluted in what seemed like gallons of water.

“Because the Earth has an atmosphere, it doesn’t completely block the light on the moon. Some of the red light actually bends through the Earth’s atmosphere and lights up the moon during a total eclipse, and that’s the rusty red, blood moon,” said SubbaRao.
No more coals to Newcastle, no more Hoares to Paris.
… I was quite taken out of myself and vowed a vow there to go to Rome on Pilgrimage and see all Europe which the Christian Faith has saved; and I said, "I will start from the place where I served in arms for my sins; I will walk all the way and take advantage of no wheeled thing; I will sleep rough and cover thirty miles a day, and I will hear Mass every morning; and I will be present at High Mass in St. Peter's on the Feast of St Peter and St Paul."
To be found sleeping in a public place is like being found without visible means of support—an indictable offence. Further, it is an indication of sin. "He sleeps rough"—therefore he is, doubtless, a thief, a drunkard, and a liar. There seems no reason why similar evidence should not be brought in a contrary sense to prove a man's worth.
He was nervy and restless, sick of waiting and sick of hiding. He had slept rough again the last two nights, once in Hyde Park and once under the arches at Charing Cross.
I have written about Sostratus elsewhere, describing his bulk and enormous strength; how he lived in the open air on Parnassus, slept rough, ate what the mountain provided, and performed deeds which matched his name—killing robbers, and making roads through unbroken country and bridges over impassable places.
Children ran and played by the roadside while others slept rough on the dirt. Hard skin on feet, blackened toes, tattered shorts, skin and bones.
In England, meanwhile, government figures show the number of rough sleepers – a small fraction of the total homeless population – climbed from 1,768 in 2010 to 4,677 last year (and since the official count is based on a single evening, charities say the real figure is far higher).
[T]he 44 Governors . . . spent three days in tense, often heated discussion of the enormous political and fiscal problems handed to the states under President Reagan's "new federalism." Said Wisconsin Governor Lee Dreyfus: "There is some apprehension on the part of the Governors that we are getting the short end of the stick."
[W]orking people are sick and tired of the bosses getting million-dollar bonuses and the workers getting the short end of the stick.
Benjamin crossed his right, a short punch traveling less than six inches, as he and Murphy stepped back from the breakaway. Many of the spectators did not see the blow that laid the West Philadelphian low. It was a "sucker punch," as Nick Hayes would have it. Coming out of a clinch, Benjamin took one step backward, then stepped forward before Murphy lifted his arms, crossing his right simultaneously, and zowie-- it was curtains for one of the millions of heroes of the "Big Fight." Jimmy dropped back on his haunches. His eves appeared to be clear, and he knew what he wanted to do--but apparently couldn't do it.
I learned the hard way that people who ditch cable TV still get the short end of the stick.
The Championship highflyers almost got their reward for a resilient performance on their first visit to the Emirates, surviving a flurry of first-half Arsenal chances before hitting back with a classic sucker punch.
"She army volunteered me," he says. "She said, 'You called; you're on the committee.'"

As cult leaders go, Rajneesh was straight out of central casting. His preferred garb was a satin-trimmed velvet robe and shoes, usually adorned with expensive jewelry.
He was not the pompous university president from central casting, always pontificating; he was more like a charming professor who walked around his campus wearing the navy blue cap of his beloved Boston Red Sox and who just happened to be university president.
The fact that David Cameron, the conservative prime minister, is a plummy-voiced, Eton-educated, upper-class Brit from central casting has played into [Alex] Salmond's hands.

I do know, though, that the cumulative effect of all these three- and five-minute film clips, with their almost unvarying implicit deference to the importance of purely military solutions (despite a few commentators' disclaimers to the contrary), and with their catering (in part unavoidably) to a popular democracy's insistent desire to view even as unbelievably complicated a war as this one in emotional terms (our guys against their guys), is surely wide of the mark, and is bound to provide these millions of people with an excessively simple, emotional and military-oriented view of what is, at best, a mighty unsimple situation.
“I was thinking of flowers being not just a pretty face. They produce oxygen and keep us alive,” said the designer backstage.

I've heard a rumor that Bujold started the Barrayar series as Star Trek fanfic, and there's enough resemblance there to make that seem very plausible to me. Suppose she did. By filing off the serial numbers, she was able to make the universe her own, to change as she needed to.

“Bottom fishing during and after financial crises is nothing new,” says Jerry Haar, a professor at the business school of Florida International University.

Corruption is a force multiplier for the West's enemies, and yet the West continues to accept dirty money into its economies by the billion.
Taken together, the articles exposed a dark truth: “Dirty money” — terrorist financing, drug cartel funds, fortunes embezzled from developing nations, the profits from organized crime — flows so freely through the world’s most powerful financial institutions that it has become inextricable from the so-called legitimate economy.

Some analysts say the mediocre performance of the asset-allocation funds may result from the massive amounts of data their managers must sort through: central bank policies, business cycles, stock values, inflation rates and sector performance in various markets, both here and abroad.

This column is about the greatest thing since sliced bread.
"The stock market has gone down, but it's just a bump in the road," she says.
Because if he starts to write a check for the full amount and I say, “Take off $250”, or “I'll throw in door-guard trim and five steel radials for nothing”, Charley is going to think I am the greatest thing since sliced bread.
If there is a potential bump in the road for the NBA in the UK, it is its lack of a television deal.
It was the greatest thing since sliced bread when it first came out, and I remember selling a big project to a customer by demonstrating it.
Believe it or not, that ugly little town was the county seat originally, when Pickax was only a bump in the road.
The town of Juliette, Ga., wasn't even on the map until after 1991. . . . Now, the one-stop-sign bump in the road is officially marked along Georgia's long and lonesome Highway 16.
We're in high cotton now.
If anyone can restore dignity to a franchise that has been close to a laughing stock in the last few years, it's Gibbs.
Toronto Transit Corporation had real issues. … My boss was removed in a coup three months after my arrival. I stood in and my learning curve went through the roof. Over five years, we went from being a laughing stock to winning awards.
Okay, let me explain this in layman's terms.
A system for creating software that runs, unaltered, on all sorts of computers and devices . . . could transform the software business in the network era from a one-horse race led by Microsoft to a true contest.
I would like to get into this $3 million deficit, Doctor. I would like to hear about it in layman's terms rather than accounting terms.
Now these "rich young brats" have succeeded café society, the jet set and the beautiful people as social pacesetters.
Polo . . . is a jewel of a game for the beautiful people, though, and nowhere is there a higher incidence of beautiful people than Palm Beach.
If you kept on worrying about being killed you could end up in a rubber room.
Barry is... well, what? Borderline autistic and obsessive-compulsive, with serious anger management issues and a dangerous behavioural disorder that in the real world would get him a one-way ticket to the rubber room.
The film briefly visits a “rubber room” in New York City where idle teachers accused of misconduct wait months and sometimes years for hearings while drawing full salaries.
“We'll give you a lift, darling,” Lady Genevieve said languidly, rising. “It's time we made a move.”
"Do you want to stay for another or shall we make a move?" He looks at his watch. "Yeah, let's go."

[T]he video how-to site Howcast . . . breaks from its more staid counterparts, such as Expert Village and eHow, by injecting a necessary dose of humor. Come here to learn "how to make a move on a girl while watching a movie on a couch".
The tour guide was certainly up on his history.
Says Sigismondi: "I don't watch [MTV]. I'm really not up on what's trendy."
In its first decade, prize business was settled in the smoke-filled rooms of London clubs, where it remained resolutely insular.

He knows he's been naughty, but it will take a while for it to sink in.
The gravity of what I had done hadn't sunken in yet.
We are simply in too deep to consider extrication from today's technologically infused world. To assert the contrary is akin to seeking disconnection from the human race itself.

Evander Kane just beat the clock in the final hour before the NHL lockout, agreeing to terms with the Winnipeg Jets on a six-year, $31.5 million contract.
Judge Randall Thomas dropped a dozen theft charges against Hunt . . ., ruling that the indictment came after a three-year state statute of limitations had run out. One ethics charge—punishable by up to $10,000 and 10 years behind bars—did beat the clock.
Came not all hell broke loose?
From getting a good night's sleep to keeping your teeth and gums healthy, there are plenty of tricks you can employ to beat the clock.
Of course I was a fool. My father has the whip hand of me, because he has money and I have none, and it was simply kicking against the pricks to speak as I did.
That is a rather difficult task, hands down.
The announcement of the political endorsement was timed to a T.
I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down to your country-seat, where,—as your Honour takes so much pleasure in fortification, we could manage this matter to a T.
Mrs. Heidel. My ſpurrit to a T.
That accounts for my having the dress, but it don't account for the piece that you left sticking to the rose-bush under Mrs. Lander's bed-room winder, which piece I took off that morning, and which piece I matched with the dress after you pitched it at me over them bannisters; it was an awful scragly tear, and it fitted to a T.
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
Into the valley of Death / Rode the six hundred.
Even Mrs Clinton, the heavy hitter, will need every ounce of her formidable powers.
Mr. Faggus gave his mare a wink, and she walked demurely after him, a bright young thing, flowing over with life, yet dropping her soul to a higher one, and led by love to anything; as the manner is of females.
"So you're going back to college in a fortnight," I said to the Bright Young Thing on the veranda of the summer hotel. "Aren't you sorry?" "In a way I am," she said, "but in another sense I'm glad to go back. One can't loaf all the time." . . . How full of purpose these modern students are, I thought to myself.
Charles Wigoder, the 34-year-old chief executive of Peoples Phone, the mobile telephone business, is very much a bright young thing—the kind of businessman who features in magazine articles called '40 under 40', alongside other rising stars who have done unlikely things at unusual ages.
As a bright young thing—which, it could be argued, is what he remained until almost his dying day—Noël Coward wrote letters filled with effusive glee.
"And what's a penny wedding?" "It's a' kin' o' a custom amo' the fishers.

[T]his poor Cordwainer, as we said, was a Man; and the Temple of Immensity, wherein as Man he had been sent to minister, was full of holy mystery to him.
. . . heavenly messengers, travelling through wide fields to explore the mysteries of creation, carrying intelligence from outpost to outpost of God's universe, his ministers to do his pleasure, and announcing their advent, or bestowing their blessing, as they speed their onward course, in a halo of glory, filling the temple of immensity with their train.
In 2008, after what you imagine was a tired and emotional dinner, the novelist Michel Houellebecq and the philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy determined to start writing to each other about the things that kept them awake at nights.
It was unclean and he would have nothing to do with it. So she took what she could get, the mercy fucks that were tossed at her like meager bones and let it go at that. Lee could not understand why she just didn't pack her bags and leave.
There's nothing like a singalong with tired and emotional Lib Dems [headline]
I watched as the guy in charge did nothing and the whole place went to hell in a handbasket.
That's as messed up as a soup sandwich.

After the birth of their son, Stanley, the couple moved to Bradford and "lived over the brush" in West Bowling in a back-to-back terraced house.
The food got a lot worse after the restaurant changed hands.
The line has since changed hands several times, and is now to re-open as a preserved railway (a railway for leisure only), running vintage diesels and electrics, but with the aim of restoring steam.
After meeting again that afternoon with Donna, Wilbur had advised her that she was indeed between a rock and a hard place. She could not hope to recover and build back the lost business until the suits were settled, and it appeared that the only way to settle the suits without going to court was to liquidate the mortuary assets or tap into the Clifton's personal funds.
If Washington Mutual needs to raise capital quickly, it will very likely find itself between a rock and a hard place, because credit markets have all but closed their doors to troubled banks.
Paul stood stock still; then came a strong impulse to turn and run back.
Israeli intelligence minister Yuval Steinitz said all options were open for Israel. "If we have no choice, we have no choice...the military option is on the table," he said.
See you next Tuesday — it's a dirty insult. The initials make a dirty insult.
In the Guardian for 2 November 1989, Katie Campbell mentioned the disparaging See You Next Tuesday as a description for an unreliable young man (= cunt), and commented: 'Imagine a word so powerful that it has to be disguised, even when used as a term of abuse.'
"See you next Tuesday," she said crisply, the camera holding her in close-up an extra beat for emphasis. You could almost hear the thud of knowing viewers falling off their chairs. In decades-old high-school vernacular, "See you next Tuesday" is code for the word that starts with the letters "c-u," means female genitalia and is used to insult a woman when "bitch" just isn't strong enough.
'See you next Tuesday.' I learnt that at my convent school (My mother was Catholic). We would say it to the nuns who didn't have a clue what it meant...
It was like Tinker to Evers to Chance. Colson-Chance then flipped the good news to Hugh Scott, who read Mrs. Beard's denial on the Senate floor that same day.
When it comes to computers, though, systems integration is too often more reminiscent of the Keystone Kops than Tinker to Evers to Chance.
Spiegel caught the names Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg, whom he gathered were a kind of upscale Tinker to Evers to Chance.
But the thing of it is, when to begin
But the thing of it is, everybody was rooting for the other individual and I was the only one rooting for him.
Is correct laundry folding really a hill to die on?
That high-school football team only scored 18 points all year! No wonder they were dead last in the league.
And compared with Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and 14 European countries, the United States ranks dead last, with the highest death rate for people under age 75 from conditions that could have been treated or prevented with timely medical care.
Don't tell him the headline's misprinted; you don't want to tickle the dragon's tail.
Not all of us are protected by having common names or by having rare names which are all but impossible to remember or spell correctly.¶ However, I haven't seen evidence that such protection is especially necessary. On the gripping hand, con badges with nicknames seems like a low-risk way of making some people more comfortable.
Princeton's defeat by Annapolis is regretted here as the Staggs say if they win in the East it won't be held as such-a-much, whereas if Chicago loses the East will grin and give Western football the jolly old Bronx cheer.
There is no reason, no sound reason—forgetting once more the beer-weeping—why our restaurants should not step out and claim the world's championship, give the homemade product the Bronx cheer, and have done with all this nonsense.
"Why doesn't he write a few words to you? Or you could write a few words to him." / "A Bronx cheer on you." / "It's my letter," Teddy said. / "I don't care who writes it," said Newman. "I could write a message for you wishing him luck. I could say you hope he gets out of here soon." / "A Bronx cheer to that."
In London or New York in the late 1970s dada meant what it meant in Paris and New York at the end of the First World War: a not-quite-naked prank, a jape clothed in the barest g-string of aesthetic authority, a Bronx cheer in three-part harmony, Tzara's affirmation of the right “to piss and shit in different colors.”
The original ending [of Charles Ives's Symphony No. 2] is preferable; the final dissonance in the published version is a Bronx cheer completely out of the spirit of the rest of the work.
He [Louis XIV of France] lost major battles and wars, signed ruinous treaties, handed over territories to his enemies, and so completely undermined his personal reputation that in 1715 his corpse was greeted with Bronx cheers as it went to its resting place.
As I walked up to the stage, numerous members of the audience recognized me and mostly yelled out, "Good luck," though there were some Bronx cheers. I felt like a heavyweight fighter approaching the ring to the cheers and boos of the crowd.
She seems to take the shotgun approach to holiday shopping, buying many smaller, generic gifts for everybody.
We did some detective work and found out that the water was getting in through a cracked pipe.
We went for a walk along the beach, watched the sunset, and then capped it all off with a lovely meal.
You expect me to clean up all this mess for you? Do me a favour.
Debbie remained seated. "Go to bed," she ordered., "With you here? Why what do you think I'll do, cut my throat with an electric razor? I know this dump's enough to drive anybody nuts but do me a favour."
If I spilled wine on their new carpet, I'd never hear the end of it.
A hospital van dropped off a homeless paraplegic man on Skid Row and left him crawling in the street with nothing more than a soiled gown and a broken colostomy bag.... Police said the incident was a case of "homeless dumping" and were questioning officials from the hospital.
Asnicar said forensic officers were examining the Murray Street house, an operation he said which could take “several days” ... This will be done to the nth degree and we will cover every angle.
His long-awaited portmanteau, which premiered in Cannes on Monday, is the most Anderson of all Anderson films. It's Anderson distilled, Anderson squared, Anderson to the nth degree.
That hat dates from the year dot.
Disk interfaces have been around since the year dot, as people soon realised that the microdrive was unreliable, unstable and generally rubbish for the storage of anything, useless except as a rather small beermat.
The award may be given to anybody who consistently writes top notch content.
[Abbas's] tenure would be taken as an opportunity by various Young Turks to cement their own claims. Men such as Gaza security chieftain Mohammed Dahlan and his former West Bank counterpart Jibril Rajoub may have their eyes on the prize.
"It was an honor to watch the determination and focus as Sydney locked her eyes on the prize and shot a 5-under par 31," Cavaliers' coach Lee Smith said.
fol. 66 b l. 13 the letters under erasure were something like cacis.
It is not unlike Derrida’s device of writing under erasure in which a term of metaphysics is used at the same time that it is cancelled out.
A concept is said to be “under erasure” when it is put in question or under critique. This signifying practice, employed by Martin Heidegger and, after him, by Jacques Derrida and other deconstructive critics, is described by Gayatri Spivak as “to write a word, cross it out, and then print both word and deletion. (Since the word is inaccurate, it is crossed out. Since it is necessary, it remains legible.)”
What is under erasure in the discussion of justice in the original position is all knowledge of the features that distinguish one person from another.
It was to acknowledge this difficulty that Heidegger proposed in Zur Seinsfrage (1955) to write “Being” under erasure, so that the visible crossing-out of the word would display its negation as an act taking place within time.
page 9 (dialogue): He pees me off on TV. Have we anything of his I could read? page 37 (dialogue): Pee off, this is a private conversation, hey?
She'd given her face a lick and a promise, drawn her hair back tight and walked in.
She had not had time for a proper bath in the week since this journey had begun. She had been forced to bathe in the washbasins of the inns along the route, giving herself what her old nursemaid would have called “a lick and a promise.”
Well, he knows hes supposed to make his bed before he goes to school, so he gives it a lick and a promise and walks out of the room.
Rising out of poverty will require not a lick and a promise but deep reform.

For a start Minister Varadkar, without seeking approval from on high, set off on a solo run informing the public that not everything in the pie-in-the-sky programme for Government was achievable.
Seven weeks later on May 27th, Conibear and his men faced a tough California crew on Lake Washington and defeated them going away in a time of 16:56.
I have never been chewed out like he chewed me out. . . . It must have worked because we went out in the second half and beat them going away.
This may be called milieu control. The Chinese Communist prison is probably the most thoroughly controlled and manipulated group environment that has ever existed.
Although milieu control is more obvious in the situation of a prisoner whose environment is forced on him, spiritual purgation often begins with a similar structuring of a person's physical environment.
A reliable system of indoctrination requires nearly total milieu control in which the indoctrinatee has few or no alternate sources of information and values.
The totalist administrators 'look upon milieu control as a just and necessary policy, one which need not be kept secret.' The assumption of 'omniscience' and 'ultimate truth' leads these administrators to consider it 'their duty to create an environment containing no more and no less than this 'truth.
Her upper body strength has been improving since she started pumping iron at the gym.
This kind of milieu control can be brought about through coercion, but at its most successful it convinces individuals that they are acting autonomously — as is the case for the ex-POW Sergeant Raymond Shaw in The Manchurian Candidate. The result is that milieu control disrupts the 'balance between self and the outside world', resulting in 'a profound threat to [the individual's] personal autonomy'.
I was feeling just as I had felt in the old Malvern House epoch when I used to sneak down to [the schoolmaster]'s study at dead of night in quest of the biscuits he kept there in a tin on his desk, and there came back to me the memory of the occasion when, not letting a twig snap beneath my feet, I had entered his sanctum in pyjamas and a dressing-gown, to find him seated in his chair, tucking into the biscuits himself.
In applying Erikson's totalism concept to the Thought Reform experiences of his subjects, Lifton famously identified eight 'themes' of the totalistic milieu: Milieu Control, i.e., monopoly of the spatial and informational environment.
Such accounts are consistent with what Lifton described as milieu control, a key aspect of ideological totalism. As Lifton postulated it, this is primarily the use of techniques to dominate the person's contact with the outside world but also their communication with themselves.

If you will name the price you put upon the articles, it is possible the damage may be quietly settled between us, and all hard feelings forgotten.
I have no horse in this race; I just want to see justice done.
This foreign visitor asked me how I felt about the war, and I told him that it was over, and I bore no hard feelings.
The eviction itself went relatively smoothly, but the hard feelings it generated resound deep inside Israeli army barracks.
A ten-pound note doesn't go far these days.
The defense played the race card, but Ito let them.
Moreover, some leaders on both sides of any racial divide love to play the race card to keep themselves in power.
White man: White privilege? Now you're just playing the race card., Clio: No. I'm not "playing the race card". Because racism isn't a card game to me. It can get me killed or jailed... threaten my livelihood. I don't have the privilege to treat it like a game., White man: Oooo well played!
Three new examples of Hollywood's staple commodity, the horse opera, all filmed in color, contain the full quota of galloping and gunplay.
The Ravels, after having played a successful engagement at the Metropolitan, closed last evening, and sail to-day for New-Orleans, and now we have no amusement but nigger minstrels and the horse opera—i.e., circus.
Indeed, they may muddle along a little better, armed with the view that the world is subject to their control.
But evidence from the past few years indicates that Russia will continue to muddle along and that, in a few years, it will probably “muddle upward”.

He [Vitus Theodorus] was called to be a Paſtor at Norinberg, his own country, … till it pleaſed God to put an end to his labors, by tranſlating him out of this vale of tears into his Everlaſting Kingdom, Anno Chriſti 1549.
While we ſojourn in this vale of Tears and Sorrow, we are detain'd from the bleſſ'd Sight and Enjoyment of God; and kept from the Happineſs of juſt Men made perfect.
But let us recommend all to god, who alone know what ſhall befal in this vale of tears, this evil world we have here, in which there is ſcarce any thing to be found without ſome mixture of iniquity, impoſture, or knavery.
We must not call earth a vale of tears. It is neither pious to do so, nor in any respect proper. We might as well, nay, with far greater propriety, call it a field of laughter.
I excused myself and dropped to the rear of the procession, sad at heart, willing to go hence from this troubled life, this vale of tears, this brief day of broken rest, of cloud and storm, of weary struggle and monotonous defeat; and yet shrinking from the change, as remembering how long eternity is, and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote.
Driven by such a hope, as if refusing to recognize this world as a vale of tears where (as they taught me) even injustice is foreordained by Providence to maintain the balance of things, whose design often eludes us, Salvatore journeyed through various lands, from his native Montferrat toward Liguria, then up through Provence into the lands of the King of France.
So it was steady as she goes as Sally was hustled into bed, and on the stroke of twelve a fourth Aintree child entered this vale of tears.
As we devour the Earth's resources and despoil the environment, we are driving ourselves into a metaphoric vale of tears.
That, in this pilgrimage of ſeventy years, / O'er rocks of perils, and through vales of tears, / Deſtin'd to march, our doubtful ſteps we tend, / Tir'd with the toil, yet fearful of its end: …
If, friendleſs, in a vale of tears I ſtray, / Where briers wound, and thorns perplex my way, / Still let my ſteady ſoul thy goodneſs ſee, / And with ſtrong confidence lay hold on thee; …
But though life's valley be a vale of tears, / A brighter ſcene beyond that vale appears, / Whoſe glory with a light that never fades, / Shoots between ſcattered rocks and opening ſhades, / And while it ſhows the land the ſoul deſires, / The language of the land ſhe ſeeks, inſpires.
Jerusalem is the city of tombs; the valleys of Halcedoma and Jehoshephat are covered with them; and the living appear to have no other task assigned to them than that of keeping watch over these deposits of ashes. … Such are these places of lamentations—these vales of tears—these vast repositories of death.
[I]n the New World, Christianity had provided the major vehicle of cultural expression for the slaves. It could not be denied them in a Christian country—and it provided them with solace in their "vale of tears," guiding them through "the valley of the shadow."
If you want a parliamentary democracy with responsible and accountable ministers, you have to complement the high-profile political role of a minister with that of a neutral, faceless bureaucrat, confined to the role of an adviser.
The faceless bureaucrat, the rigidly rule-bound and unresponsive public servant, the mysterious labyrinth of corridors, the long customer service wait times—these are all part of the imagery of public bureaucracy deeply imbedded in American culture.
Probably the most powerful of the myths about the modern administrative state concerns the identity of the typical bureaucrat. The faceless bureaucrat of myth is inefficient and lazy on one hand, aggressive and hyperactive in meddling in people's lives on the other. But in truth bureaucrats are ordinary people.

So when leaders keep around C players (or the warm bodies), the result is almost always worse than having nobody for a short period of time.
Why just hire a warm body, when you can hire for loyalty?.
... but the plan came off the rails when infuriated Communists called it "ideological provocation" and warned against "kindling political confrontation

Reread through the manual until the instructions are crystal clear in your head.
Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings?
For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you're doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.

Duncan was wounded, and the escort hooked it.
Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

As a graduate student, she loved being a “lab rat,” Dr. Blackburn said, adding, “I was just really focused on the science, the science, the science.”
Looking back at the unprecedented meddling of European powers in his country's politics amid the Euro crisis — a series of events that led to his fall as well as Greece becoming the first country in the zone to be forced to accept painful austerities in exchange for bailout loans — Papandreou told TIME, "I think it couldn't have been avoided. We were a lab rat, an experiment."

It was refreshing that what raised the hackles of Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells had nothing to do with a colourful range of jumpers, nor a flighty Italian art director/photographer.
The inanity of the British attack is obvious from some of the words the early Disgusteds of Tunbridge Wells complained about.
Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer, And without sneering teach the rest to sneer.
The patronizing manner in which the hero of Nashville is damned with faint praise would amuse were it not so exasperating.
Four of them returned it with a cold, printed note of rejection; one of them “damned with faint praise.” They wrote that “Our readers report that they find some merit in your story, but not enough to warrant its acceptance.”
And then, finally, when W. could avoid it no longer, he mentioned Vice, damning with faint praise: “Dick Cheney’s advice was consistent and strong.”
I (whatever the others might do) saw nothing for it but to comply.

Whisky he sipped at suspiciously, and still had not got an adult taste for; but wine he loved, and he put back champagne as if it were lager, with awful belches and chuckles after each glass.

[H]is words were grave, his manner was earnest, and his speech came from the fulness of his heart. If there had been a false note, a false look, Harry would have detected both.
Shreve creates a little world, peoples it with believable characters, and puts them through agonizing and joyful moments without a false note or a dissonant figure of speech.

Clay remained in position, forward on his bull rope, spurs raking the bull’s side. It looked as if it was going to be an easy ride, albeit a low-scoring one. Bold Lancer had other ideas.

This tribe lived largely upon the smaller animals which they bowled over with their stone hatchets after making a wide circle about their quarry and driving it so that it had to pass close to one of their number.

Rodarte just dropped the mic on fashion week. After last season's esoteric tribute to "Star Wars" – really, how many women would wear a gown emblazoned with a giant Luke Skywalker? – sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy's dazzling spring outing mixed the right amount of fantasy and commercial appeal.

No matter what I do, he always finds fault.
My supervisor always finds fault with my work.
He doesn't, but he's a man with an eye in his head, and he knows what we are, a boneless lot without organization. I say it myself, I said it only last night in this here bar, and I say it again, for two pins I'd chuck my party. I would so.

When it was finally time to board, we got on the train to find out that we’d been put in business class. This was a turn up for the book, reclining seats and room to stretch out a little.
Her mother kept well away from us, which was a turn up for the book, and for the time being at any rate, I was a model husband.
All these turn ups for the book had lasting consequences.
'Well, boyo, this is a turn up for the book,' observed my friend David Llewellyn without a trace of irony. 'I never expected to wind up in a hospital bed next to you.'

We won the game fair and square
He said they give licenses now to steal — steal folks'es senses away, and then they would steal every thing else, and murder, and tear round into every kind of wickedness. But he didn't ask that. He wanted things done fair and square: he jest wanted to steal horses. He was goin' West, and he thought he could do a good business, and lay up something. If he had a license, he shouldn't be afraid of bein' shot up, or shot.
For the "Most Accurate Assessment of an International Situation" the unanimous winner is the Republican U.S. Senate hopeful from California, S.E. Hayakawa. He said, "Of course we should keep the Panama Canal, we stole it fair and square."
“The life of a Negro in Mississippi is not worth a whistle,” one of the European newspapers reported.
This, of course, is ridiculous, as most people can plainly see, but you'd be surprised at how often otherwise intelligent individuals fail to distinguish between what's worth fighting over and what's not worth a whistle.
We note Bateson's (1968) dormitive principle at work in which behaviors are described as traits such as LD, which then are used to explain the behavior.
If we examine traditional explanations of behavior through the lens of recursion, we will sometimes find what Bateson called "dormitive principles," a form of circular description. A "dormitive principle" is a more abstract repackaging of a description of the item you claim to be explaining. To paraphrase Bateson, this occurs when the cause of a simple action, as for example, when aggression is explained as being caused by an "aggressive instinct" or psychotic symptomatology is attributed to "madness."
And to any intelligent reader, explanation of an 'inherent ability' was reminiscent of Molière's mock explanation of the soporific effects of opium - that it contained a dormitive principle.
Grey power is increasing its influence over the world's tourism industry—and with a new nickname. If you're over 60 and have the time, the inclination and the funds to travel, you're now a "bloomer", according to a British holiday company.

Every Elliott and Crawford and MacAllister is on the warpath, loaded for bear.
Whoever has taken a critical and serious look at human history will indisputably come to conclusion that man's madness and craziness know no boundary or limit even when check and balance of power are being applied.
Madness, even under the pretext of despair, is never a force that can regenerate the world. That is why today we are all Americans.
In this way, moral check and balance is combined with legal check and balance (i.e., legally based check and balance).

For many years Bud Abbott served brilliantly as Lou Costello's deadpan straight man.
Recently he had successfully concluded a case featuring a poet who wore only latex, lived on liquorice allsorts and worshipped a horse she believed to be the reincarnation of Radclyffe Hall. And she was the straight man.

As usual, it makes a difference which foot the shoe is on. All too often the farmer has been willing to vote for legislation as long as he was exempted [ … ] But he doesn't like it when it is proposed that laws he supports when they apply to others also be applied to him.
Those two are incessantly flattering one another. They've formed an utterly nauseating mutual admiration society!
Some of those involved with the Broadway Triangle proposal, however, dispute the coalition’s claims that the project unfairly excludes minority residents. “It all depends on which foot the shoe is on,” said Rabbi David Niederman [ … ] “Other groups are trying to dilute the chances of Jewish families getting access to affordable apartments by trying to include another large community board in the development.”
And the said members did accordingly resolve themselves into a little "mutual admiration society" for the entertainment and benefit of their visitors.
Vandeloup smiled at this, and came to the conclusion that the Wopples family was a mutual admiration society.
"In a sense, I've always felt on the outside, looking in," Mr. Douglas says. "It's my background, damn it. My father was an illiterate Russian immigrant, a ragman, the lowest rung on the economic scale. There were six sisters and my mother; I was the only boy. To be a young Jewish boy in a town—Amsterdam, in upstate New York—that was quite anti-Semitic."
If you don't want a mutual admiration society, which dies as soon as you've all discovered each other's faults, you must nobble the Press.
Joe DiMaggio and Willie Mays had a mutual admiration society and the Clipper was happy to put his respect into writing.

Any open challenge would likely come first as trial balloons from backbench "stalking horse" candidates, who could never win.

While these cool people could have been visiting with peers and gathering insights in the exhibit hall, they chose to hoof it on up to the north forty, “over the river and through the woods” so to speak, and spend forty-five minutes with me sharing their thoughts.
[T]his brand of ecstatic meditation, shared by the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, has struck a chord with record-buyers, and works such as "The Protecting Veil" (1989) for cello and strings have achieved cult status and huge sales on disc.
The photos struck a chord online and quickly went viral.
"Testing the waters" is a veil for what candidates do in the years when it's too unseemly to be seen actually running for president. . . . But this veil is dropped when candidate and handlers believe the coyness has begun to cloy. And then the candidate's dance of the seven veils has begun.
Mr. Putin’s succession and (likely) restoration is a leisurely dance of the seven veils in which one veil is dropped only for another to be donned.
We knew then the jig was up, and it was no grin matter for us.
How my father came to hear of this little stroke of business I never knew, but some little bird or other whistled it to him, and he was very soon down upon me in right earnest.
When I first told 'em how the jig was up with us, that the British were going to have the land, without any fighting about it, I never see fellows so mad before in my life, unless it was Major Eaton at Washington when he sot out to flog Mr. Ingham.
Nas walked through the garden of Gethsemane in his 1999 music video. Other scenes featured the rapper being crucified on the cross. Say no more.
After I had returned home in the spring of 1893 from Washington, where I saw so many gray-haired men who had held high elective office begging for the crumbs from Cleveland's table, I gave my wife an account of what I observed, and told her that when the jig was up for me I would hasten back to Missouri to begin the practice of law once more and be a man among men.
The universe works in strange ways: just when you think the jig is up, you get a second chance.
He’s almost taking out an onion now as he remembers his father and his own early struggles.
The detectives were trying to identify the big enchilada who controlled the entire criminal network.
The very essence of drama is the creation of a rooting interest. In all your successful pictures, Connie, that rooting interest was the heroine, the character you played.
When the lottery results were announced, he was stunned to learn that the big enchilada was all his.
Shareholders took a bath when the company went bankrupt.
He won't show his no-good ass around here again.
In the high-risk world of futures contracts, pooling the risks could be just another way to take a bath.
The lenders took a bath because they had to honor fixed rate loans of 5 to 10% while borrowing money at 15 to 20% to fund them.
The fastest way to take a bath in the stock market is to try to prove that you are right and the market is wrong.
"'I learned long ago never to wrestle with a pig,' Ching likes to say, 'You get dirty and besides the pig likes it.'"
"Whenever a boisterous and argumentative person cries to draw you into a public discussion or a wrangle, just remember this bit of advice. "Don't wrestle with a pig. You'll get dirty which is exactly what the pig likes."
At the tail of the long list was Mr. R. P, of Fitzwilliam Hall, the " wooden spoonist."
While I was at the Dartmouth Review, we used to tell the deans that taking on our campus paper was like wrestling with a pig. Not only did it get everyone dirty, but the pig liked it!
'From the position of “wooden spoonist” [Gloucestershire] rose to the honourable position of fourth in the list, and became once again a team whose drawing capacity as regards “gate” was unsurpassed by any other County.'
If I concur to that I will be skating on thin ice.
I swallowed the official version totus porcus.
As a founding principle of our trip, Margaret and I decided that if we were going to go, we would go whole hog, totus porcus, super deluxe all the way
I once heard father say that, with all his faults, he was the best of the bunch.
Then there is Lucy; she is the best of the bunch, which is not saying much.
He proved the best of the bunch. He deserved better than being frozen like a Popsicle under that glacier.
Mal could tell too, just looking at those goons, that they stirred shit day in and day out.
The King has stirred shit up and caused the people to fight amongst themselves instead of organizing properly to fight against him.
It seems to be saying one or both of two things. One is that any score that comes out of any procedure that purports to measure intelligence is a value of the scale, intelligence. If so, this would be Humpty Dumptyism.
If thou wilt be ſaved by the Law, it is not thy endeavour or doing; what lieth in thee that will ſerve the turn; every jot and tittle that the Law requires, muſt be fulfilled.
They deſire indeed to be exact in every Jot and Tittle, in the very ſmallest Points of Chriſtian Practice. But they are not attached to one Point more than another; they aim at uniform, univerſal Obedience.
O all ye twelve Holy Fathers of our tribe! what a losing venture is this for one who hath duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of Moses.—Fifty zecchins wrenched from me at one clutch, and by the talons of a tyrant!
That is not to say, for a regime to be meaningfully constitutional, every jot and tittle of its formal constitutional language must be followed in every case. It is to say first, there must be a substantial correspondence between the actual arrangement of governing power and that described in the constitution and, second, the individual's rights created by the constitution must be taken seriously by those who exercise governmental power.
At the party he behaved like a real horse's ass.
Obedience to the rules of the dance is more poetic than military, more pomp than mundane legalism—for skilled dancers are less concerned with the jot and tittle of their regimen than with the perfect harmony of their movement.
The flip side of failing to recall an irregular form is tripping a false alarm for one when the verb is in fact regular. Word lookup is not instantaneous, and as it proceeds a few irregular verbs in memory might crudely match a regular probe. That could temporarily slow down the rule until the last jots and tittles of the word are properly matched and the false matches have petered out; only then will the rule be allowed to proceed unhindered.
That is one horse's ass of a paint job.
Roger was in the library, trying to choose, from an embarrassment of riches, the ten of his father's books which he was to be permitted to take to the city.
What might be an embarrassment of riches—a city with three independent and artistically distinct opera companies—may become a lose-lose-lose situation.
Her latest novel is all sizzle and no steak.
Y2K may be the equivalent of the Kohotek comet—all sizzle and no steak.
The volatility of children is proverbial: from the cradle their attention is attracted toward the visible objects around them, particularly towards those which shine or move, or emit sound. Thus they have accustomed themselves to be all eyes and ears; not indeed for the dumb language of a book, or for lessons which are often monotonous and unintelligible, but in order to see and hear whatever may stimulate their natural curiosity.
But the Devils found another gear in the third period and found the energy that had been lacking throughout a sluggish second period.
“I am,” ſaid I, “incenſed againſt your Governor, for the Noiſe he made. Priſoners are all Eyes and Ears; though locked up, they come to the Knowledge of whatever paſſes: They hold that every little Motion concerns them, and trace it to the Bottom. […]”
Swimmers talk about finding another gear when they need it.
Seated by my mother, and keeping the ſilence that cuſtom preſcribes to young women, I was all eyes and ears; but when we chanced for a moment in private with Madam l’Epine, I aſked her a few queſtions, the anſwers to which elucidated my obſervations.
Management's ultimate goal is to become one of the world's top five automakers. That will require finding another gear.
It's amazing that after seven-plus seasons as one of the most consistently compelling shows on TV, NCIS still finds another gear with certain story arcs.
The new normal for this country is simply to survive economically.
I hope you will comply willingly; it will speed the day when I can bow out and life can get back to normal — a new normal, free of the Authority, free of guards, free of troops stationed on us, free of passports and searches and arbitrary arrests.
To find out, Personnel Magazine recently conducted a panel discussion with Andrew S. Barrett (senior vice-president, personnel, Nabisco Brands, Inc. and a member of AMA's Human Resources Council) focused on the role of the human resources professional in managing personal change in an era of institutional upheaval—what he calls the “new normal."
Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado said mass shootings could not be the “new normal.”
Gabriele Salvatores's "Mediterraneo" is a deliberately charming comedy whose most daring conceit is that love, in one form and another, makes the world go around.
Money makes the world go around. And every year we make resolutions to save more of it, invest it more profitably and spend more wisely.
Last year a committee of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America issued a report guardedly approving Birth Control. . . . [M]any Presbyterians heartily disapproved. Last week the Presbyterian General Assembly met in Denver with Philadelphia's Rev. H. McAllister Griffiths and a corps of Fundamentalists on the warpath.
Boating enthusiasts, walkers and others who enjoy relaxing by canals were on the warpath last night after British Waterways announced plans to cut 180 staff.
As the crash dive began at 1:50 p.m., the overboard ventilation valve had not been closed, which resulted in tons of water flooding the submarine.

Well, gang, it's time to gather around the table and put the feedbag on.
She always wore the most disgustingly old-fashioned clothes and she could moan and complain for England but the thing that really bugged Sharon about Anne was that, despite having the disposition of a wet weekend in Scarborough, she always signed her departmental notes 'Annie' and she always turned the dot on the 'i' into a flower.
She could sleep for England. It's not unusual for teenagers to sleep for England, I know, but I believe Amy experienced depressions in her early teens.
Good week for: Cyclists, after Britain's most prolific bicycle thief was banged to rights.
I know I should hate being there without you; I'm a great old thing, as Jasper says, neither fish nor fowl, you know, not come out, and not a little girl in the schoolroom, and it would be very horrid going to a grand place like that on one's own account.
"To tell you the truth," he confided, "I am a little tired of my job. Neither fish nor fowl, don't you know."
Ms. James, who has been a blues, rhythm-and-blues, funk and soul singer, said she no longer had to worry about being "neither fish nor fowl."
After failing in 2003 to drag Canada into a disastrous war in Iraq, Stephen Harper has achieved it in 2014. And he will sleep better knowing that, when he next dines with the American president and fellow NATO leaders, he won’t be relegated to the kiddie table.
Organized by Fox News, the main stage, prime-time debate will involve only the candidates polling in the top 10. According to the most recent numbers, Trump, Bush and Walker are leading the way, with everyone else competing closely for the remaining slots — and to avoid the afternoon kiddie table debate.
The East London Line gained a connection to the Jubilee Line Extension when a new station was added at Canada Water in 1999, but its big break came in 2010, when it was incorporated into the London Overground, a network that rehabilitates some dowdy and obscure suburban lines (most particularly the old North London Railway) to create an orbital railway for the capital.

Don't ever use the hood on your anorak; and, if you do, for heaven's sake don't pull the string tight so that you peep out like a little baby in a siren suit.
Well, for heaven's sake! Look who's here! Good to see you again!
I'll go and get a bite to eat after school.
[E]ven to characterize these cases as affirmative action is misleading. What critics often present as a thumb on the scale for "less qualified" individuals may in fact reflect only necessary adjustments in the way the scale is calibrated.
The data show that the television campaign ads this money buys put a thumb on the scale in criminal cases, and undermine the promise of equal justice.
The police did not arrest the drug dealer since he was small fry compared to his boss.
These slot machines are just the small fry. The big games are in the back room.
Can we quit horsing around and get some work done?
Stop horsing around with the controls, before you break something.
As Norah Jones coos sweet nothings on the soundtrack, the happy couple—played by Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler—canoodle through a Manhattan montage, making pasta for two, swimming through a pile of autumn leaves, and horsing around at a fruit stand.
At the end of the conference, they awarded him with a rubber chicken as a booby prize for complaining the loudest.
The despised pauper, most likely a foreigner, when his spirit has gone to its final resting-place, is probably carried to the Potter's Field.
I look at them. They're the boards of a novice-recently-turned-intermediate surfer. 'Does Garrett have any boards in the van?' 'Ooh, shots fired. What's wrong with my boards, eh?'
There was a Potter's Field, a cemetery for the poor and friendless, far out in the country.
Drake clapped back less than 24 hours later with "Duppy Freestyle," in which he talked about once being a fan of Pusha's, called out "Infrared" producer Kanye West and warned that he'll be sending an invoice for all this extra publicity he's giving Pusha and his new album. And Drake really did send the record label an invoice for "promotional assitance and career reviving" with a $100,000 fee the next day. Shots fired!
Hart's Island has been used for the past 50 years as a potter's field for the burial of the paupers.
Potter's field. The commissioner shall have charge of the Potter's Fields, and when the necessity therefor shall arise, shall have power to lay out additional Potter's Fields or other public burial places for the poor and strangers and from time to time enclose and extend the same to make enclosures therein and to build vaults therein, and to provide all necessary labor and for interments therein. The Potter's Field on Hart's island, however, shall remain under the control of the department of correction, and the burial of deceased paupers therein shall continue under rules and regulations established by the joint action of the departments of social services and correction, or in case of disagreement between such departments, under such regulations as may be established by the mayor.
Humboldt had been buried not in potter's field but far out in Deathsille, New Jersey, one of those vast, necropolitan developments …
[A]nother $8 million went to keep alive Quebecair, a corporate welfare bum if ever there was one.
Elon Musk . . . is also — and this you read less about — a serial, almost kleptomaniacal, corporate welfare bum whose greatest talent seems to be sucking at the U.S. government’s teat for personal gain and glory.

Mrs. Joiner is over the hill.

You've been nice enough, but what am I, chopped liver or something?
Two hundred and eighty million dollars in the Union's welfare fund. That ain't chopped liver.
Well, now, I wouldn't make this change seem like a major overhaul. After all, you weren't exactly chopped liver before! But I did sense that you were deliberately trying to downplay your attractiveness, for whatever reason. Not that you succeeded, of course.
God is the father of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. What about Sarah and Rebecca? What about Leah and Ruth? What are they, chopped liver? All your god respects are the men. Women are nothing to Him.
Dolly suggested that they should meet at the club at 4 p.m. Sir Felix had named noon, and promised to call at Dolly's lodgings. They split the difference at last and agreed to start at two.
Zaid is especially happy with his friend's visit (you know, the one he keeps telling us is his only real friend ever – I guess we were chopped liver).
In terms of both price and efficiency, the Malibu Eco attempts to split the difference between a conventionally powered sedan and all-out efficiency champs like the Toyota Camry and Ford Fusion hybrids.
But it really rankled Mets fans when anyone assumed that the Yankees were New York's main baseball team and the Mets were the little brother, the chopped liver, the city's second team.
Someone had hit the pause button, and I ended up on the waiting list. My beautiful plans had just turned into chopped liver.
Be that as it may, the duty of all communicants lies plain.
Prison reform and the rehabilitation of prisoners need to be part of the fight against crime, since it is critical that revolving door syndromes of criminality be arrested.
But be that as it may, the principle of it is founded in truth.
We English people, be that as it may, have among us the best nursing for love and the worst nursing for money that can be got in Europe.
It has frequently been asserted in the Indian press that the United States does not understand India's position. . . . Be that as it may, it is certainly true that some sectors of Indian opinion likewise do not adequately understand the motives of the United States.
"They seem to think I'm photogenic." Be that as it may, and Rollins surely is a striking figure, his music and only his music matters.
"Nevermind, I'll give you a hundred dollars for it," said the king; "you did me out of horse and saddle the other day, and the bridle too, but I'll let bygones be bygones, if I get the pot."
To intrude as little of his personality as possible upon a gay event with which that personality could show nothing in keeping, he decided not to make his appearance till evening—when stiffness would have worn off, and a gentle wish to let bygones be bygones would exercise its say in all hearts.
You'll find, when you come back, I promise you, Kit, that everyone is willing to let bygones be bygones, and that you can make a fresh start.
But I ain't got no quarrel witcha. Just let bygones be bygones.
"How wildly you talk, Margaret!" exclaimed Mr. Birtwell, with increased irritation. . . . Mr. Birtwell started to his feet and walked the floor with considerable excitement.

All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
... men who supposedly enjoyed equality and freedom, but in fact did not. The rich more equal than the poor at Strasbourg? ... is there a gap between what human rights say they do and what they actually do?
All the world leaders at the G-8 Summit are supposed to be equal in stature. But in some ways, President George W. Bush is more equal than others.
He clearly believes some states are more equal than others.
"The horses smell the barn right now," said Capt. Clark D. Carr, the battalion's Protestant chaplain, who knows perhaps better than anyone how badly they want to leave.
I visualize the finish line to keep going—like the horse smelling the barn—and try to finish as strong as I can.
Smelling the barn can result in driving too fast, not clearing weapons properly, and bypassing ammunition-recovery procedures.
Mr. Rollins . . . is probably as well known for his big mouth as he is for his campaign savvy, a quality that has made him a favorite source for reporters and often cast him in the role of "the skunk at a garden party" in political circles.
Boy howdy. There was indeed no rest for the wicked.
"Talk to me, Zaidu. What do you mean?" she asked quietly. "I'm more than a little confused here. I know what's happening in my life." Boy howdy, did she!

Demaso, trying hard to scrub a wall behind one of the toilets, started complaining how dirty the walls in the entire bathroom were. Tripp also chimed in that they were polishing a turd and that what the bathroom needed was a fresh coat of paint.
A mere two months after the New Orleans hearings, the Supreme Court dropped the bomb that Eastland and other white southerners feared: Brown. Much as the Chinese Communists' victory and the Russian's building of the atomic bomb in 1949 had ignited the Cold War and anti-Communism, the Brown decision took the struggle for and against black freedom to a new level of intensity.
I'll zip up my lip.
Sylvia finally returned my calls yesterday, and while I was in the middle of chewing her out about the airconditioning, she dropped the bomb. Said it didn't matter because she'd sold the building.
Natasha gulped and tried to look cheerful when she dropped the bomb on him. “Four down, forty-six to go.” Jeff froze. “Excuse me? Did I hear you right? That means you have to buy fifty Christmas presents?”

While he spoke thus, the good man leaped with joy; and as he was a widower, they advised him to put himself agian to the ranks. 'No raillery,' said he, 'if I were always as young, I might yet do something to speak of.

I have the feeling that even while the clock is ticking we are moving on to terrible things.
We know the clock is ticking, and the longer it takes us to find the person who has been kidnapped, the less likely the case is to have a successful outcome.

If you were to walk into a salon in America after a few 10–12 hour days of sweaty, dusty travel with no shower, you'd probably be politely asked to leave and not return until you've cleaned up.

There may be a kernel of truth in the story of how George Washington confessed to his father that he chopped down the cherry tree.
Whether the Duke of Wellington really said of the Eton playing-fields that it was there that the battle Waterloo was won, may fairly be doubted. The story has many elements of the myth about it; but, like other myths, it has a kernel of truth.
This statement will be unacceptable to many biographers and historians, but there seems to be a definite kernel of truth in it.
It's about a young man (Billy Crudup) who tries to distill the true biography of his dying father (Albert Finney) by looking for the kernels of truth in the many tall tales he has told.
He was disillusioned to find that even Lincoln had feet of clay.

He remembered the snickers and feeble excuses girls had offered him when he dared to ask one for a date. “Yes, I'll go out with you on the second Tuesday of the week.” Such a remark was usually accompanied by giggles or outright laughter.

Whereas the growth of new middle and upper classes remains a thorn in the flesh to the Communist Party, the military element is inclined to favor this development, in the belief that those who have something at stake are more likely to fight to defend the system in the event of another conflict.

1. Let us go to the wood, says this pig; 2. What to do there? says that pig; 3. To look for my mother, says this pig; 4. What to do with, her? says that pig; 5. Kiss her to death, says this pig.
He had run two miles, through the woods, to see the new baby. There were more wild-cats than babies in the woods of Kentucky. Besides, this baby was his cousin. He said that he was "tickled to death" to have a boy cousin.
Are we to be crucified just to save the faces of our leaders or to bolster up the preposterous that India can be a single nation? Is it with a view to achieve a compromise at all costs, or is it to support the illusion that Hindu nationalism is working in the interests of Muslims as well as Hindus? Irony is flattered to death by a mental muddle of such a nature and on such a scale.
So far, they have always claimed that we have built this country, we have paid our debts, but with this they bled the country to death and have hoarded enough money to ensure their escape.
"I don't want to revisit his view and my view about whether I should have retired and who said what then," he told ABC Radio. "That's been done to death."
Now, though, it was six-thirty—high time for them both to be back, whatever the trouble— and a roast cooking to death in the oven.
The slow cooker demands less involvement on your part [ … ] There are foods -- chicken, for example -- that you can overcook, but as long as you choose things that you want to cook to death anyway, it isn't going to happen.
“Look,” George said. “If we get pregnant, I will take the baby and raise him on my own.”, “Not likely!” cried Alice.
“She's a butter face,”, Harold looked at her for a minute and then back to Mr. Fink. “A butter face?” Repeated Harold not knowing what Mr. Fink meant.
We went through the whole agenda, from soup to nuts.
[That cat] is a broken reed to lean on in the matter of catching mice. My own acquaintance with him is a longstanding one, and I have come to know his psychology from soup to nuts. He hasn't caught a mouse since he was a slip of a kitten. Except when eating, he does nothing but sleep.
I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
All my dreams for him have been cut short in the twinkling of an eye. Why was my son murdered?
The finer and more distinctive features of a land require deep study and long acquaintance, but the broader traits of nationality are caught in an instant, or not caught at all. Familiarity with, destroys them, and it is only at first blush that we learn to appreciate them with force.
At first blush it appears rather strange to consider for even a moment the possibility that corporate financial and business disclosure rises to the dignity of speech protected by the First Amendment.
Third, it is only at first blush that one finds no exercises in conceptual elucidation
That may sound innocent at first blush, but a phrase like "American leadership is good … for the world" is a signal that these people want to impose their will on others; and when military strength and moral principle are added, the caution flag must be raised.
At first blush it seemed the attacks by the werewolf were random.
I knew I couldn't cast the first stone as I knew I had weaknesses. ... (But) as a leader of the government trying to uphold the rule of law I have no choice but to move forward and say you cannot accept perjury in your highest officials.

Well, their reputation is down the toilet.
"Whoever the hell is running the place now has made a terrible mess of it," he said... "Not in the sense that it looks different, or that it isn't pretty much permanently full. It's just that the food as gone utterly down the khazi."
Today we hear a lot about those who have had what's often called Road to Damascus experiences on every issue from guns and same-sex marriage to the sanctity-of-life and taxes.
[…] That was my Road to Damascus moment. They played one hit after another and this is the song I remember most clearly.
The candidate is aggressively branding himself as Vernon 2.0, a kinder, gentler Vernon Jones, a bridge builder, a fence mender. Asked by a Rockdale editor about his “road to Damascus moment,” Jones laughs. “I got knocked off my donkey,” he says.
I'm not happy about the friends my son is running around with at the moment.
He ran off with my wallet.
The point being that most of the work at the grunt level was not being done by FEMA, which never had many bodies, or even by the National Guard, which should have had many more bodies, but by Regular Army units.
This is a book about war at the grunt level, and another reviewer was good enough to remark that the story is “told straight.”
The chief accountant has run off with his secretary!
Women can run, blacks can run, all sorts of people can run. We didn't think people like that could win in years past. That conventional wisdom is out the window now. That's good news.
it's bad for principles that we thought were the basis for post Cold War security -- for example, non-aggression, pluralism, tolerance, things of that kind, and they 're out the window now. I mean this- this framework, for these principles, are the antithesis of principles that we allegedly were backing over the last 45 years of the Cold War.
It is a total, consuming quest to run for president of the United States, and to be president of the United States. You have to realize that privacy is out the window.
They're part a formal letter, part some type of dialogue. So, what are the rules? Is it okay to throw formality out the window? Does spelling matter?
Life had gone out the window and scampered off.
I've had enough of working nights, so I'm going to jack in my job.
We are completely snowed under at work because it is the end of the tax year.
In the hospitals they're moving, / Moving on; / They're here today, tomorrow they are gone; / When the bravest and the best / Of the boys you know "go west", / Then you're choking down your tears and / Moving on.
You'd think, to hear some people talk, That lads go West with sobs and curses, And sullen faces white as chalk, Hankering for wreaths and tombs and hearses.
This went on for a while, until one morning I came in about five to eight, not quite due on the shop floor yet, and I stopped outside the tearoom, put on my best Smiler voice: 'Right, lads, come on, let's be having you, let's have you on shop floor now, lads, come on, stop messing around in there with tea, come on, let's be having you.'
You've just been volunteered, friend, so let's be having you.
All the same, where did the straight goods leave off and the horseshit begin?
The News wrote that the mayor “let loyalty get the better of his duty to provide the public with straight goods.”
He made his reputation as a legal beagle as a prosecutor before entering private practice.
Is she the straight goods, or is she a gold digger trying to con him?
For our part we are quite willing to pass the immortelles to Outerbridge Horsey, Banker Stillman's legal beagle.
He was a hale and hearty man at that time, and remained hale and hearty for many years afterwards; so hale and hearty, that in the year 1798, being then turned seventy-eight, and having lived in America ten years, he married a young woman of Scottish extraction
Marshall, who didn't know the process server was after him until the legal beagle was called off by his congressional bosses, settled the whole affair late this afternoon by giving the committee the papers it wanted.
This is a hale and hearty dish, filled with beef, potatoes and carrots.
You don't want to be a legal beagle about it. You are not a dog! Still, a passing familiarity with employment law isn't such a bad thing when you're working for others.
If I were ScotRail management, I'd be looking at the feasibility of taking some more trailer cars to make them five-car sets, and even the possibility of using them on the West Highland, Kyle and Far North lines as well (although I fear that is a cost too far, but food for thought).
B: Welcome to my world! I've been doing it for three years now.
I find it extraordinarily difficult to explain why it is that she has always put the wind up me to such a frightful extent.

The little girl in me was crying, "No more." She was large and in charge, front and center—the lead actress in the play about her life.

There's no chance to sleep on the matter, you have to decide now.
The act . . . gave the USDA "authority to set nutritional standard for all foods regularly sold in schools during the day." That was a bit of a bone in the throat for parents who think their children should be governed by the smallest bureaucracy possible.
K.T. Oslin once made a living as a Broadway chorus girl, and when she turned to country in her mid-40s, it was to sing about such nonbucolic topics such as older women sleeping with younger men.

She read Gone With the Wind from cover to cover in less than six hours.
Ever since she was placed in the gifted program, she's become so high and mighty that no one wants to be near her.

During [Tucker] Carlson’s keynote, he wedged sneers at his critics for crying “racist!” in between racist remarks about [Ilhan] Omar, jeremiads against the media (“I know there’s a bunch of reporters here, so . . . screw you”), and an attack on Elizabeth Warren and her donors (“She’s a tragedy, because she’s now obsessed with racism, which is why the finance world supports her”)—all to gleeful applause.

The school authorities, unable to take a joke, demanded the immediate removal of the satirical poster.
https://books.google.com/books?id=WGkFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA45 page 45 The bill for the temporary removal of the seat of Government of the United States to the city of Baltimore was taken up for its second reading. [ … ] https://books.google.com/books?id=WGkFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA48 pages 47–48 Does it not show, in terms of unequivocal meaning, that it was the opinion of the men best qualified to decide, that the seat of Government, once fixed under the provision of the constitution, must be permanent? It was not then imagined that the Government ought to be travelling about from post to pillar, according to the prevalence of this or that party or faction.
How often we see men who have been nearly everything in the world outside the unelastic professions—directors and secretaries, clerks in all manner of offices, and managers of all sorts of schemes—knocking about from America to England, and from Australia to Japan; without specialty, but with a good general business faculty, understanding all about tare and tret and double entry and working up a business, they are the very embodiments of the popular saying, and are flung from pillar to post and from post to pillar, as a juggler flings his plates or balls from one hand to the other.
I don't want to run around all week getting everything ready for the holidays.
[S]he . . . made a note to suggest that her client ease some of the last quarter's profits into tax-free bonds. Render unto Caesar, sure, she thought, but not one damn penny more than necessary.
Still, the ideal solution, I think, would be to render unto Caesar an affirmation of flag and country but to keep God in our hearts.

His vote demonstrates that the people of Philadelphia are not asleep at the switch, are not indifferent to their political duties.
My guardian angel had not been asleep at the switch.
It is sometimes difficult to guess whether a sentence has been garbled by the author or the typesetter. . . . In either case, the editors were asleep at the switch.
If it is a new constitution, the historico-legal method is probably the most appropriate, since the events leading up to the introduction of the constitution are still so recent and relevant that they must be used for guidance when the constitution is interpreted.
North not only makes Hoover primary in the FBI's complicity in the cover-up, a fairly common mistake, but also attempts to implicate Hoover in events leading up to the assassination.
About all you need to do is paste up the finished art for the printer.

He [Jack Spicer] had come to New York to escape the claustrophobia of being a big fish in a small pond, and to make his way as a writer.
Indeed, Josh [White]'s status throughout the 1950s would often be that of a big fish in a small pond. The major labels, films, and network television shows were barred to him, but the newer, smaller folk promoters considered him an established star, and some, at least, assumed that his price would be out of their reach.

I think the lady down the road is a few sandwiches short of a picnic—you often hear strange bangings at odd hours in the morning.
He said to hang on, then went to his bike and came back with a black case. When he opened it I suddenly thought I was dealing with someone a few sandwiches short of a picnic.
When the vessel showed some symptoms of unsteadiness, I arose, walked gravely up to her, ranged the pilgrims around her with their shoulders to the sides, and told them to heave with might. . . . Each Maghrabi worked like an Atlas . . . and, sliding heavily through the sand, once more floated off into deep water. This was generally voted a minor miracle, and the Effendi was respected—for a day or two.
He was a nice fellow, but we all know he was a few sandwiches short of a picnic.
The engineers at AMC have wrought a minor miracle in modifying this archaic transmission so that it is merely inconvenient instead of being an outright disappointment.

The other technique, known as the "magic asterisk," consisted of hiding phony cuts in the small print of various budget documents in order to exaggerate the Administration's success in spending reduction and to minimize the projected deficit.
"They have a magic asterisk," Hoyer said. The magic asterisk: The words alone are enough to strike fear into the hearts of grizzled veterans of the budget wars.
People who spent money foolishly on ostentation were nigger rich.
"What is this ‘nigger rich’ you speak of?" Grandmother Nina asked, interrupting Walter's saga. . . . "Well, ‘Nigger rich’ is an expression in America, especially the southeast, which loosely translated means: When a man who has an abundance of money, who has never had that much money, he usually goes out and spends it foolishly. It was attributed to blacks in America, because often, when they acquire a windfall of money, they seem to go out and purchase big cars, usually a Cadillac."

So do the shadows of our own desires stand between us and our better angels, and thus their brightness is eclipsed.
The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.

He produced his Agreement and, as he put it in – that is to say, tendered it as evidence – he gave me an old-fashioned look; and that, of course, told me that the rotten thing wasn't stamped.
Even though he doesn't really know how to use them, he keeps the tools around, figuring they might come in handy someday.
This is where what I learned in High School really came in handy.
In all matters relating to the family business, mum has the final say.
A charismatic personality is not necessary in most managerial situations, but can come in handy in times of turmoil when workers need to be inspired and reassured about the need for significant changes in their values, goals, and group norms.
There have been a great many things to be seen to, in order to make everything cosy, since Mr. Walsh had developed bachelor's habits after the death of his first wife, and some things had become none too savoury. I had a large array of cobwebs and hanks of slut's wool to sweep out from under the beds, and also a fair deal of scrubbing and scouring to do.

Against the glacial backdrop he looked like a lost minstrel who'd taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque.
Anyways, he must have taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque because I walked in on him using our restroom facilities and appearing to be very confused.
It takes 25 minutes for Bugs Bunny to tunnel his way into that sequel, becoming the first Looney Tune to appear in this supposed Looney Tunes movie. Maybe the rabbit and his studio both took a wrong turn at Albuquerque.

In any event, the Texas law clearly passes muster under rational basis review, which doesn't presume to grade our citizens' moral judgments as if they were submitted as part of an undergraduate exam in moral philosophy.
Although I had worked on school newspapers, I did not know what news was — that is, what events would make a story and what combination of words would make it into print after passing muster with the night city editor.

"Keep it up, Mandrake," he said. "Just keep it up. You may be the Prime Minister's blue-eyed boy now, but how long's that going to last if you don't deliver?"
Thou, too, delightest in the freshness and the bloom; thine eye follows and answers mine in its admiration of the beautiful, and our hearts beat as one to the music and gladness of nature.
It is all very fine to talk about love in a cottage, two souls with but a single thought, two hearts that beat as one, and all that sort of thing; but in any cottage that love wouldn't turn up his nose at there is very substantial rent to pay, and, even waiving the usual contingences, at least two mouths to be filled, that the most perfect singleness of thought, the most thorough union of hearts, can never make one.
Their hearts had once beaten as one. How was it possible that she could still be here if her sister was not?

There always has been a tendency to overlook the catcher, possibly because so much of him is covered up during the game, but more because the greatest part of his work is inside baseball and of the kind which the general public can neither see nor appreciate.

The stereotypical image of the "dusty miller", as depicted in popular legend and some traditional literature, is a barrier, and milling is seen by younger people as low-status.

I think the immigrant, as a rule, clings more to the homeland and to culture and music than the person who's surrounded by it all the time. That would often be the last sight of their homeland, it would be the last sight of their nearest and dearest, and yet, over and above that, they still felt the need to go and try and get a better life, whether it was voluntary and whether they were thrown off their lands or whatever.
During his 13-year career as a game-changing NFL linebacker, Lawrence Taylor hit opponents so hard he often made them see stars.
Another common error dealing with memory is that of "hindsight bias." This is the tendency to exaggerate what could have been anticipated in the past.

In other words, it is business as usual on the Korean Peninsula. Perhaps, when the atmosphere cools down, an argument can be made for giving North Korea’s leaders some of the assistance they want, if they are willing to make concessions of their own.
This was very well illustrated when Extinction Rebellion protests disrupted traffic in London in April 2019, and Mayor Sadiq Khan insisted that while he shared “the passion about tackling climate change of those protesting”[…] Londoners needed to be able to return to “business as usual”.
This vehicle would be likely to cost about $1,500 more at retail than the business as usual vehicle, which achieves 33 mpg.
Mickey was wide receiver on the St. Rita Football Team in 2007—a big strapping, robust south side knuckle dragger and chick magnet.
“Fuck y'all niggaz! I'm getting out the business anyway. I don't need y'all!
He enjoyed the Countess Rossakoff's society partly because of her aristocratic provenance, and he was not going to have his enjoyment spoiled by a spectacled little girl with boiled gooseberry eyes and a degree in psychology!
“Little strokes fell great oaks,” says the steady worker. “One stroke fells not an oak,” makes a piece of advice to the impetuous. In danger the insignificant may console themselves with the reflection that “Oaks may fall and reeds brave the storm.
These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come to grief perhaps.
Immediately beyond Churn Lane the climb begins at 1 in 78, steepening to 1 in 66. Speed soon falls and a number of heavy hop-pickers' specials have come to grief here.
She was a woman of caprices, and her caprices always ruled the day.
[C]ommon sense rules the day. . . . Everything can look suspicious, but only the umpires can tell if the ball's condition has been altered.
Vintage watch collecting is growing in scale and value in a way we have never seen before. Condition and rarity are ruling the day in driving prices to new levels.
Collins' death can be put down to his devil-may-care attitude—his decision to journey through hostile territory in a large convoy, the inadequate choice of the members of the convoy, and the tactics he adopted in the ambush. For all the debate about ballistics and entry and exit wounds, and the use of powerful historical imaginations, it matters more that Collins was killed than how he was killed. Concentration on the events at Béal na mBláth has, moreover, often meant a failure to place them in the overall context of the war.
So he who does unbelievingly, whatever he does, does ill; and he who does ill, sins. The good works which an unbeliever does are the works of Him who turns evil to good.
We exercise our power over others by doing them good or by doing them ill—that is all we care for! Doing ill to those on whom we have to make our power felt; for pain is a far more sensitive means for that purpose than pleasure:— [ … ]
Seems to me I been on foot all over hell and half of Georgia, since this ruckus began.
Idiot, she scolded herself. You've tracked Alex through hell and half of Georgia, only to fall in a stupid well!
Mariner's lowly drifter has some dirt. This makes him King Shit of Fuck Mountain in his World of Water, and the atoll where he comes to pimp his wares.
The hitch is that the ship is so powerful—it must be, to do the things for which it has been designed—that its twin rotors blast away Hell and half of Georgia with the turbulence it causes on landing or taking off.
Life is too difficult. O. Greenbaum, H. Knape, T. Kornflower, J. Davenport, all would agree that “Life is but the span from womb to tomb; a sigh, a smile; a chill, a fever; a throe of pain, a spasm of volupty: then a gasping for breath, and the comedy is over, the song is ended, ring down the curtain, the clown is dead.”
A crafty man-of-the-world keeps his finger to the wind.
... God gave the Kingdom unto David for ever, or by a Covenant of Salt.
How they choose: They hold up a finger to the winds of recent awards results
This is a reform that the ancien regime, always with a finger to the wind of public opinion, spotted as an electoral nightmare and ducked.
"He's a huckleberry above a persimmon, for sure," Katherine said, following her gaze. "I hear tell he broke a lot of hearts in San Antone when he married you."
I thought now the jig was mighty nigh up with me, but I determined to keep a stiff upper lip.
A man may go pretty near through his whole sea-life without any call to show a stiff upper lip.
In typical British stiff upper lip fashion, the tournament organizers expected us to play into, and through, the menacing weather.
"You'll catch it, you know," said Tom, nodding his head in an admonitory manner, and hesitating a little as he took the scissors.
The film's considerable taste for graphic, noisy violence becomes clear during this tumultuous opening. So does its mean streak, as the Colonel delivers outrageous insults to one and all.
If they beat us, we shall catch it, and serve us right.
I'll catch it for your mischief in running away. And I'll catch it again when the tutor claps eyes on the handwriting.
I've kept some money in the bank for a rainy day.
"The position you'd put me in would be this—of playing a game—and a jolly important game at that—in which the loser loses to me on purpose. . . . If we're going to play a game," he continued, addressing Davenant, before the latter had time to speak, "for Heaven's sake let us play it straight—like men. Let the winner win and the loser lose—"
He added, "I think the American people want a President who will play it straight in foreign policy, tell them the truth."
Peter Schickele, the musical satirist and radio show host whose PDQ Bach Christmas concerts sell out Carnegie Hall each year, is not known for playing it straight.
Belfort, who made millions on Wall Street before the FBI indicted him and he served nearly two years in federal prison, told the audience he could have made a lot more money if he had played it straight.
"They could have made a fortune just playing it straight, but that wasn't enough for them," said Gill. . . . The brothers ultimately pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy and bank fraud.
The bus was oppressively warm and the air-conditioning was fighting a losing battle with the heat.
Sartre rejects the notion that an imagined character possesses, in any rational sense, "a life of its own".
[…], information takes on not only a speed of its own, but a life of its own.
A massive hangover with a life of its own kept Fess pinned to his bed most of Sunday.
John told us he had lost his job, which put a damper on the celebrations.
I bumped into an old mate of mine, Bill, the other day whom I was banged up with in 1972 in St Bernard's Hospital. He's on the dry now but he told me he has had several lapses since we left muttering that it was all going to be different tomorrow.
Then, maybe two weeks before cameras rolled, he'd put the blinkers on again and totally focus on it, and that included staying off the booze. 'I'm on the dry,' he'd announce.
Three eminent mainstream British economists told MPs . . . that the government had struck the right balance between cuts and spending. Austerity is bang on the mark, they said.
Well the weather is similar, the hot dang LLVs are still cooking up a storm yet we hardly get the old Hill Street Blues adage of "Let's be careful out there" and any form of liquid is noticable by its absence.
If she was mad at me, she'd frown, stomp around a lot, cook up a storm, then talk when she'd calmed down.
It is hard to remember a talented player who so comprehensively bothered, annoyed, outraged and just plain torqued off the customers quite like Owens.
Also-rans such as Dale Jarrett, Kevin Harvick, and Kasey Kahne were torqued off after hanging close all year only to find themselves shut out of a shot at the title.
Unlike Oasis, the point wasn't simply to have it large and live a whacked-out existence as professional rock stars.
In the poem, the poet just gives a pen picture of his father, who according to him, represents all that is best in Aryan culture.
Here is a pen picture of a child lacking ego integrity.
[ … ] that cultural theorists could be forgiven for thinking that every young Briton between the ages of 15 and 25 was out having it large.
On the dance floor, people are having it large: hands in the air, whooping and yelling, boogieing in a sweaty drug fueled mass.
"The hell you say!" ejaculated the man, in amazement. "This Glidden is a German agent—perhaps a spy. He's no labor leader."
"The hell you say," Mr. Brzezinski replied indignantly, according to Mr. Allen, "Henry was working for our side."
He would move heaven and earth to make sure his family is healthy.
Head office brought in all those new policies without consulting anyone and now people are upset and nothing is working right? The hell you say!
I hope he will give up the argument, or to use a familiar phrase acknowledge the corn.
I should like to take a job of that kind on a wager with him, or any other New Hampshire man, and if I did not come out a little ahead on the "home stretch," why then I would "acknowledge the corn," and own myself beaten.
Will the hon. gentleman acknowledge the corn? He does not do it. He is non-committal.
They had simply to "acknowledge the corn," round up, and — "vamoose"; then, so soon as the soldiers had gone back to the fort, there was no law to prevent their returning.
Gun shop owned said people get them for all different reasons like saving money and getting a cheap thrill.
He's a big fat idiot.

As Jürgen Klopp took Sadio Mané in his arms and spun him like a beloved ballroom partner, there was a moment of sing-song communion with the Kop. They love these big fat emotional notes here.
You all know that in the due course of time / If you continue scratching on a stone, / Little by little some image thereon / Will he engraven.

Coming after a fast, colorful movie like Super Fly, a follow-up called Super Fly TNT is a wet firecracker.
[A]udiences sensibly enough found Lollobrigida and Sinatra to be a wet firecracker of a team.
Politics for me was strictly a spectator sport.
The singer Britney Spears, whose descent into a personal abyss has become a ghoulish worldwide spectator sport, yesterday left a Los Angeles hospital.
Thompson, who's the digest's publisher, says bird watching is a hobby, a pastime and a spectator sport that can be enjoyed anywhere.
Rubbernecking is only a spectator sport.
Well, well, we must bide our time. Life isn't all beer and skittles—but beer and skittles, or something better of the same sort, must form a good part of every Englishman's education.
Being a soldier's wife isn't all beer and skittles.
His plight reveals a truth that's often obscured by the envy of newspaper readers; that it's not all beer and skittles in restaurant-critic land.
We slid into our office, past two women discussing the "X factor," an apparently undefined quality their firm felt they lacked.
The map can be misleading. It can appear to contain all the relevant information, but in real life, there is always an X factor.
Whether it's trade, global warming, Darfur or North Korea, China has become the new x factor, without which no durable solution is possible.
I feel lonely at times, but then somebody phones, or calls round, and I cheer up again.
If at times Van Gaal’s players let themselves down with careless concessions of possession, Carver knew his side had been reprieved when, back to goal, Wayne Rooney controlled the ball on his chest, swivelled and dinked a shot wide.
This means, at times, long and perhaps overly discursive discussions of other taxa.
I had to run down cellar to turn off the water main.
All About Eve (1950, FoxVideo). [Marilyn Monroe had] already had mini-roles in eight movies when she turned up as George Sanders' arm candy in the party scenes of this film.
Friends described her as always ready to serve as "arm candy"—that is, a pretty date—to industry players, in hopes of landing a role.
Foot voting provides much stronger incentives than ballot box voting for both information acquisition and rational information use.
Foot voting is an inherently selfish individual move; it is not intended to serve the body politic.
The new crop of reality shows brings us that much closer to the contestants, warts and all.
I would have to give you full marks for that statement.
Sir Cred. Spare me, good Doctor!
All you have to do is go to the interview. The job is yours for the asking.
[ … ] he [Mavji Dave] said: ' [ … ] I would far rather that you sent him to England. My son Kevalram says it is very easy to become a barrister. In three years' time he will return. Also expenses will not exceed four to five thousand rupees. Think of that barrister who has just come back from England. How stylishly he lives! He could get the Diwanship for the asking. I would strongly advise you to send Mohandas to England this very year. Kevalram has numerous friends in England. He will give notes of introduction to them, and Mohandas will have an easy time of it there.'
It’s not exactly a Pixar-level examination of complicated family dynamics, and the movie still has plenty of knuckled-headed, Sandler-style boys-will-be-dumbasses shtick: Children everywhere will surely thrill to the sub-subplot about Frank catching hell about his gambling problem from his wife, Eunice (Fran Drescher)!
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that "all men are created equal"^([sic])]

Four score and seven years ago, I began writing an annual letter to be enclosed in my Christmas cards.
Will it work? It's a tough call.
Minor writers, seeking a fashion to follow, may praise or blame various groups pretty much according to which way the wind is blowing, but the work of a writer like Ernest Hemingway, most people would agree, goes its own way.
The reality of international diplomacy is that, like the senators in Julius Caesar, countries follow power, hide their weapons, watch which way the wind is blowing, and then back who they expect to be the winner.
“Apparently that dog of hers joined you in the water.” “Yes, that's right, he took his dip with the rest of us. But what's that got to do with it?” “Wilbert Cream dived in and saved him.” “He could have got ashore perfectly well under his own steam. In fact, he was already on his way, doing what looked like an Australian crawl.” “That wouldn't occur to a pinhead like Phyllis. To her Wilbert Cream is the man who rescued her dachshund from a watery grave. So she's going to marry him.”
Vinyl records seem to have gone the way of the dinosaurs [i.e. become extinct, or fallen out of common use].
It seemed to be a really good opportunity, but it turned out to be nothing but a put-up job.
If the evidence for modern Darwinian theory is so overwhelming, they should have called the bluff on the other side and come and made their arguments. ... They should have put up or shut up.
The technique in the rendition of the texture of the robes is there, but the face is painted in so low a color key as to give the impression that the good doctor has been undergoing the nitrate of silver treatment.
[H]e said to himself that he was a very good-looking man, and could have adorned a much higher sphere in life than that in which the accident of birth had placed him.
It’s lucky for you he got himself assassinated before the good Pope’s Vatican’s ratline and America’s CIA high level Nazi SS scientists lifelines who operatively could smuggle him along with his two pals Eichmann and the good doctor Mengele, the SS Angel of Death, to Argentina.
"You're no brother of mine," she broke in. "At most it is an accident of birth I disown. I'll have no relationship with you of any sort."
Well, almost no one: according to one story, a polite lady commended the good doctor for not including swear words in the dictionary. “I see you have been looking for them,” he is said to have replied.
An accident of birth had made him a citizen of the United States—his father having owned a ranch which lay north instead of south of the Rio Grande.
“The good doctors tell us he is better of the wound,” resumed the mother.
With all respect to the good doctors at the university-based institute who evaluated him, they were not up on the literature on mental giftedness.
Then came a disquisition on pride, with quotations and commonplaces;—then an eulogium, by his lordship, on his lordship's own knowledge of the human heart, and more especially of that "moving toyshop," the female heart; then anecdotes illustrative, comprising the gallantries of thirty years in various ranks of life, with suitable bon-mots and embellishments;—then a little French sentiment, by way of moral, with some philosophical axioms, to show that, though he had led such a gay life, he had been a deep thinker.
THOMAS PAINE. "Oh what fun it is to be a rebel," says Mr. Bradford. Paine "was a commonplace rebel, entirely practical." Not educated, not a deep thinker.

Prices vary considerably from one town to another with no apparent rhyme or reason.
She smiled sweetly at Bryson and then turned to the men standing uncertainly nearby. “Yes, good doctors, what have you found?”
Take heed, good doctors, having world-class training and clinical skills is not always enough to fend off potential legal action.
He would often fly into an unexpected rage without rhyme or reason.
I marvel that a mind on the outs with itself should have nevertheless made a painstaking record of its every tremor.
A second ill of this day lies in the trend of getting more and more on the outs with those who have been more successful than we.
The flavors of the food hit the high notes: the rightly famous Canlis salad, the signature Peter Canlis sweet prawns floating on a sea of butter, and a succulent Kobe-style steak.
"The first country, Nicaragua, was a give-away," noted one State Department observer, referring to the GSP review of the country most on the outs with the administration.
During his public life, Obama has hit the high notes of poetic romance — his 2008 campaign.
Then there was a pause. Our new acquaintance had become involved in a vexatious difficulty with his pipe. . . . To keep the ball rolling I asked Marlow if this Powell was remarkable in any way.
The fact that he and her sister seemed to be more on the outs than ever may have been half her motivation in leaving the door open a crack.
Few people thought the Federal Aviation Administration could, as it promised, solve the delay problem at New York's LaGuardia Airport in six months. . . . Plavin, and others, hope the FAA will keep the ball rolling at the other top ten delay-plagued airports in the country.
Early TV newscasts consisted largely of "talking heads"—a reporter reading news bulletins or interviewing prominent politicians—but maps were frequently employed as visual aids, particularly for war news.
So, if you don't like this performance, blame Canada!
We surely can't blame Canada. Nike, we suspect, is where we must point the finger for what has become the somewhat too familiar norm in television advertising put forth by major global sporting goods brands. As we all know by now, it was Nike and the agency's longtime marketing partner Wieden+Kennedy in Portland, Ore., that became famous for delivering a steady stream of soft-sell advertising that sold mood, atmosphere and brand image with minimal reference to the actual goods a particular television commercial might have been created to push.
Basically, instead of blaming the U.S. government or society or poor parenting for the way our children behave (poorly), we'll just blame Canada. Everything is Canada's fault.
Blame their partner for something bad that happened [ … ] It really depends on the circumstances for this one. If the something bad that happened was your dog getting run over, by your partner, then they might deserve to be blamed for it. Especially if they were drunk at the time. This doesn't necessarily mean you’re in an unhealthy relationship. Sometimes people are at fault. And if in doubt, just blame Canada.
These objects [on the sun's surface], some of which were as large in superficial area as all Europe, and some even as the surface of the whole earth, were found to shoot in thin streams across the spots, bringing them over in well-defined streams or comparative lines,[ … ]; sometimes by crowding in on the edges of the spot they closed it in, and frequently at length thus obliterated it.
Do the companions of Muḥammad, the blessing and peace of God be upon him, think that they can have him all to themselves; by God, we will crowd in on them until they realize that they have left to come after them men (worthy of him).
Back east, wherever you look, you see something. The world crowds in on you. I can't tell you how homesick I got for the prairies, where a man can look for miles and not see anything … not feel crowded.
"One white man." said Bill, after a brief inspection. "Out on his line, I s'pose, and there's no tellin' when he'll be back. So we won't wait. We'll just serve notice on him."
In short, China's pragmatic post-Mao leaders value Hong Kong as a window on the world and a source of foreign exchange, investment capital and expertise.
[H]is main concern was to reaffirm the enduring value of museums as windows on the world.
How should he know or guess or what?
Do they check you at the door or what?" Michael laughed.
[S]he asked me, and like you, I didn't know if that was like having heart failure or what.
I don't know if she was joking or what, but I joked back with her anyway. […]. Did I take her back to her hotel room and drop her off or what?
But there remain two problems to resolve before the plan can be put into practice.
It remains to be seen whether he will win the election.
Then came the leak (to the AP) that [Lance Armstrong] had in fact told Oprah he'd been a doper. So all that remained to be seen were what words Armstrong would use and what demeanor he would display.

Brave and resourceful, creative and effective, will be the hallmarks of the transformative CEO. For the transformative CEO has no choice but to change the game, and to change the game forever.
“Crazy Rich Asians” simply changes the game. It shows that minorities don’t need Spandexed suits or powers to be bankable (though one could argue that the comedic team of Ken Jeong and Awkwafina are superheroes in their own right). They can be glamorous and sassy and intimidating and genuine – and still relate to virtually all audiences.
“If we were able to get a really high vaccination rate, that changes the game completely,” said Hassan Vally, an associate professor in epidemiology at La Trobe University in Melbourne.
"Mr. Marlowe," she told him quietly, "makes a big thing out of trifles. But when it comes to a really big thing—like saving a man's life—he is out by the lake watching a silly speedboat."
Next Mr. Gregory went on to make a big thing out of the fact that he had caught them climbing "into" the school grounds not long before. He didn't exactly say so, but it was plain that he felt he had interrupted some kind of dry run—a training exercise for a crime in the planning.
[ … ] I would, out of respect for them [Hank Greenberg's parents], go along with not playing on Yom Kippur. But evidently it made a very big … You see, the press are always looking for unusual news, so they made a big thing out of it.
One screwup and he could be splitting rocks on a chain gang somewhere in Bumfuck, Egypt.
He really took a gamble when he left his job to become a writer. But it paid off in the end.
Ahithophel, Absalom's chief counsel, hanged himself when he lost face after his advice was rejected.
When you start to feel unmotivated, you will look for ways to weasel out of your commitments. We all do it. If there's a stealth way to back out, without ever losing face, you will do it without hesitation.
He had arranged for one of his managers to be present in the office with us, so I should have realised immediately that there was little chance of him backing down since that would have meant losing face in front of a subordinate.
"What he did to her was wrong." "You know it, sister!"
"I've still got a few years on the chain gang." "Counting the days, huh?" "You know it."
He's a little bit older, mind you, but good people, if you know what I'm saying to you …" "Italian, right?" "You know it, baby, and —" "Over fifty? Widowed? Grown children?" "You're a mind reader!"
"Man, I wonder if David found out. Is that why they divorced?" "You know it."
They remembered then that they could have bought for a song canvases which now were worth large sums.
[T]he contents of aircraft that once commanded prices up to $148m are now being sold off for a song after being torn apart in Gloucestershire's aviation charnel house.
In his senior year, he had run across an old '66 Chevy Super Sport headed for the junkyard, bought it for a song, and overhauled it with his dad's help, turning it into the big red muscle car it was back in its day.
He bought it for a song in 1984 compared with what his fellow financiers were spending on tonier Park and Fifth Avenues.
And since we're so near, like birds of a feather, Let's e'en, as they say, set our horses together.
Birds of a feather do fall out sometimes.
Paul Blanshard has two bogeymen of almost equal fearsomeness: one dwells in the Kremlin, the other in the Vatican.... Blanshard has satisfied himself that Stalin and the Pope are pretty much birds of a feather.

It might be hard for her to leave London after all these years: she's put down roots there.
Ms. Couric demonstrated a self-deprecating humor and a penchant for the giggle-filled coffee talk so familiar to the early-morning shows.
Ali and Jaser met occasionally for coffee to chat. . . . “Every so often he’d talk about radicalism and that,” said Ali. “I just thought it was coffee talk.”
I haven't put down roots in this town yet, 'cause I've got trouble making friends here.
If we are to be drinking from a firehose, with billions of web pages at our fingertips, then we should possess the skills to manage its flow.
Many people suspect that scientists, riding high in the modern world, are uninterested in man's spiritual qualities, which cannot be subjected to test tube and microscopic analysis.

She liked that and sometimes she watched him as he played with his own pee pee until it made white pee all over him.
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
Everything was insipid. Every day the old lady asked me whether I liked the food, but what could she do? I was still as shy as ever and dared not ask for more than what was put before me.
"She combs me down with her tongue sometimes though, but that just slips off me like water off a duck's back."
Scandal after scandal would break, but it would be like water off a duck's back; no heads rolled, and no one seemed particularly perturbed.

The new president of the Varityper division of the financially troubled AM International, Joseph A. Verderber, knows that he has his work cut out for him. . . . "My challenge in a ship that big is to make certain that it has a good steady hand on the tiller."
Analyst Mark Brumby at Astaire said: ". . . The share register remains skewed but the current shareholders are likely to have learned from the mistakes of the past and, it is to be hoped, will provide a steady hand on the tiller."
[T]heir expressions of confidence in the new Bush administration were likely heartfelt — officials around the world reminisced enthusiastically about the scion of a president best remembered as a sober and steady hand on the tiller of foreign policy.
Sometimes I get wet right away, but other times I'm aroused but not very wet.
For six years Prime Minister Stephen Harper has promoted himself as a “steady hand on the tiller” to steer the nation through turbulent economic waters.
“It looks a bit black over Bill's mother's,” I said. “I don't like the look of them bleeding clouds for one minute.”
“Oh, that's nice.” said Mrs Jones looking out of the window at the rain. “It has gone real black over Bill's mother's,” she said using one of the old sayings from around those parts.
He was never in the service, but he acts like he was born on the Fourth of July.

Joe laughed. ‘Aye, I know I'm a funny little feller. I couldn't stop a pig in a passage, could I lass? But I'm good at me job, else Eddie wouldn't have asked me to come and look at that there roof.’

When children present with separation anxieties, they visibly ‘make strange’ or become distressed when separated from their parents or caregivers.
We would wrap our arms around each other and suck face like orangutans in his little red Fiero.
The man with the banana nose was on my right.
The apparent success of the City and South London triggered an avalanche of bills for Tube railways, and in 1892 a Joint Select Committee of Parliament set out some ground rules.
With his banana nose, hunched shoulders and hustling ways, Matthau's Buttermaker had an unmistakably Nixonian cast.
Sometimes the kids at school call me Banana Split, and when my father heard the name, he said, "You mean Banana Nose. You always had a big nose."
“How many, young Millar?” asked Flanders, a giant with tight clothes, lambchop sideburns, a ruddy complexion and an enormous nose that defied gravity. The kids called him Banana Nose.
[S]he told me very frankly that whenever I returned, she would leave her mate and come to me, as she preferred me above all others. I was becoming a ladies' man after a lifetime of bashfulness!

In the fourth [volume], we view the decline of botany in the barbarous ages. In the fifth we find it riſing with the new dawn of literature; …
We might as well be in the middle ages, whereas our sky is flushed with the rosy hue of a new dawn—the dawn of justice—justice not only to man but to woman—justice not to some men and some women, but to all men and all women! [From the Chicago Times.]
Richard Beynon, who toured Australia in 1954, and whose play The Shifting Heart won the 1956 Sydney Journalists Club playwriting competition, hoped that a new dawn of Australian theatrical writing had arisen.
More and more of us are living active lives as a consequence of life-saving treatments. … Impulsive negative responses to these new dawns are unbecoming of the human spirit. That so many of them are derived from religious beliefs should be, and is here, a concern to other religious believers who hold that the negativity is ill-founded.
Three days after Nets Coach John Calipari called a reporter a "Mexican idiot," the team publicly apologized today. . . . "The way I understand it, what Cal was trying to do was bust on Garcia," Fenech said. "Once he saw Garcia's reaction, he realized he didn't think he was kidding."
His wife bought him his first Utilikilt four years ago, but it took him six months to get up the courage to wear it outside. He finally decided to debut it at a local beer festival. "A lot of guys were busting on me," he recalled. But others wanted their picture taken with him, asking where they could get their own kilts.
For my entire life the comet hurtled sunward, and then for a fleeting moment I positioned myself in the front row to enjoy its passage as it returned into distant space. For me the 1985-86 Halley apparition will be fondly remembered long after the Halley bars are eaten and the T-shirt fades.
It's just that whenever I screw up, you're always in the front row.
Few passengers cried on the way to the prison. almost all cried on the way home. Camila and aunt Maria sat in silence at first, letting their tears stream unchecked. Then Camila asked, “is anyone from our family going to be there?” “i doubt it.” “i'm surprised. i thought Grandma Vickie would be in the front row.”
He himself had worked for organisations not always up to the task they had set, but always in the front row to declare their skills and success.
The director in the front row of your mind is the result of critical thinking. He or she is the part of you that keeps you on track, helps you stay in the moment, and gives you focus and guidance with your performance.

He denied charges that the union was using "goon squads," as strong-arm detachments are called on the West Coast, and asserted that any violence was provoked by the employers.
No one has ever accused Uganda's mercurial President Idi ("Big Daddy") Amin Dada of running a democracy. . . . In Kampala, the capital, much of the terror is committed by Big Daddy's personal goon squad, the 3,000-man Public Safety Unit.
But becoming the "Spirit Father" to a group of cave dwellers threatened by "bandits, insurgent guerrillas" and "goon squads hired by greedy logging companies" gives him a newfound purpose in life.
In my opinion, the debate around the president's latest tweet is like the price of tea in China. Absolutely pointless!
His roving eye traveled around the room, and, resting upon the three guests, became inflamed.

He encourages people not just to complain, but get into public service, or be involved. “Get in the boat and row,” is his advice.
Whether they’re an individual employee, a team lead, a manager, or someone from the overall executive team, everyone has to get in the boat and row.
He couldn't afford the expensive headphones, so he decided to settle for the lower-quality set.
As the game entered three minutes of stoppage time, both sides almost snatched the win. Substitute Admir Mehmedi was inches away with Hart beaten and Stewart Downing, on for Walcott, shot weakly into the side-netting with the last kick of the game as England had to settle for a point.
I suppose the people who wrote that stuff on the wall were trying to make a point, but they mainly made a mess.
Make a point to carry [or of carrying] your calendar with you at all times.
Siegfried and Roy, two nuts from Germany, are out of their wealthy little minds. They live in a mansion whose ceiling is painted like the Sistine Chapel, with either Siegfried or Roy (who can remember?) in place of Adam. Roy has a "meditation chamber" (the rest of us have dressing rooms) furnished with a mystic rug and cages for his tigers. They wow the crowd with heavy machinery and endangered-species eugenics. I love S&R. They march to the beat of a different drum machine.
The ad ends with a shot of Mark pushing the car down a hill and Suzanne saying, "He still marches to the beat of a different drum."
A defense of non-conformism, deceptively simple in tone and construction, and only slightly political, it is the story of a loner . . . who stays in bed on Bastille Day and ignores the military parade . . .

Everyone went to sleep in some nook and cranny of the house.
It's strange to come away from home, from your own nook and cranny, to go by ship – which is also a kind of nook and cranny – and then suddenly be more than a hundred miles away and stand in a foreign land!
Ever since the post-war spread of the motor car, the railways have had to contend with tough competition, but have had an inherent advantage in the commuter and inter-city markets. Now they are about to face two new enemies - a technology that everyone has learnt to use and a virus that many people think lurks in every nook and cranny of the rail system.

The American people want no rendezvous with a destiny plotted on blueprints in a Washington office. When they have a date with destiny they want to know what the lady looks like.
Hennessey: You need fifty grand, Griffin? I got a suggestion for you. Why don't you kill Daggermouth? Peter Griffin: Maybe I will, Hennessey.

Since most adults do not share this director's unquenchable optimism, even his best movies tend to be an acquired taste.

A man rode at an Arab who fired and missed him, and then seized his spear, with the apparent intention of meeting him as an infantry soldier should, according to Cocker.
It seems that a certain constable whose beat included Dorchester Square was going his round rather late one evening when he noticed a hansom cab drawn up about the middle of the south side of the square.

At 0-0, United will take the lead if they score the penalty.
It was an omen of things to come as in the 56th minute the visitors took the lead after a mix-up between Skrtel and Sotirios Kyrgiakos allowed Ebanks-Blake's through-ball to squeeze between them.

The house is an example of what is popularly referred to as a "ghost home," a property owned by a nonresident (sometimes noncitizen) who has no plans on ever moving in.
So then we get to the deliberate ghost home investors. How do we tell that the empty flat has been purposely left unoccupied?

To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.
The time before the Third Round of qualifying, the summer of 2012, when the impossible seemed within their reach – this was the country at its finest. Bowers had enjoyed seeing the fruit of his efforts pay off as much as he loved watching his countrymen get swept up in his soccer passion. Regardless of the outcome, he and the island's small set of believers were walking on sunshine.

[A] pair of suburban slickers [ … ] made the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour the most popular new TV show of the season. They did it by shooting from the lip, dauntlessly laying down a crossfire of patter that is often more fizzle than sizzle.
He is, as most Americans have now gathered, a blunt fellow, prone to shoot from the lip. He often speaks before he thinks.
Darrel Reid used to shoot from the lip. Few Canadian evangelists can match his record for the controversial quote, whether accusing single moms of using welfare to have babies or likening hate crime laws protecting gays and lesbians to Nazi tyranny.
"Hout, neighbour," said Mrs. Howden, "we suld live and let live—we hae been young oursells, and we are no aye to judge the warst when lads and lasses forgather."
‘Live and let live’ is my motto: let me alone and I'll let you alone.
Our Europe policy is simple: live and let live, flourish and let flourish. That is a modern and mature approach.
Mayor Smith's new traffic rules were a bad joke.
Disarmament must be total, or it was merely "a bad joke".
But it is amusing to note that whenever the tables were turned on him he would mutter "Bad joke. Very bad joke".
"Maybe it was just a bad joke. " "A bad joke!" shrieked David, and in that cry I could detect all the ancient terrors of Israel.
It is this bad joke which, almost one century later, was still to be found in the government's campaign of 'We are Europe' from 1994.
This might be a bad joke for you and to the people able to fly back to Miami but this is not a joke at all to me.
Upon seeing Keyes' face, 15 MSNBC executives promptly resigned. Alan Keyes? Alan Keyes is Making Sense Alan Keyes? You've gotta be kidding me. Incidentally, the name of that show always seemed like a bad joke to me.

Those Incarnations — they've got real jobs to do! It isn't all peaches and cream for them, any more than for us!
When I was little, I thought life was peaches and cream.
My friends told me to call my teachers a piece of shit when I was at school. I bitched out.
I'm not trying to make it sound like life as part of a championship-level race team is all peaches and cream. Nothing in life is all peaches and cream.
Life is just a just a bowl of cherries / Don't take it serious, it's too mysterious / You work, you save, you worry so / But you can't take it with you when you / go, go, go. / Oh, life is just a bowl of cherries / so live and laugh at it all.
Della thought it meant that you just get your bowl of cherries in life and that's your lot and you eat them one by one and then you die.
She did not believe that life was a bowl of cherries, and she never had.
Then it sneezed. Considering what it was smelling, that was no surprise. Tell the truth, I'd gotten so used to the jof jof dung that I didn't notice it anymore.

Kravetsky said the hospital's position is contradictory. "They suck and blow at the same time," Kravetsky said outside court on Tuesday.

In Britain, where the British BeeKeepers Association (BBKA) has been urging members to microchip their hives for some time, the continuing mystery and the belief that the crimes are inside jobs are taking their toll.
It seems to me it must have been what the police at home call "an inside job"; because whoever it was apparently knew the combination of the safe.
Wolves, sensing the comeback of all comebacks was on the cards, kept pressing and set up an exciting finish when Ronald Zubar's header was judged to have crossed the line, even though it appeared that Nigel de Jong had successfully cleared the effort.

They say America is the land of opportunity. Opportunity for what? For children to run in the dirty streets? - Mr Mousekewitz in An American Tail: Fievel Goes West
It is time the international community faced the reality: we have an unmanageable, unfair, distortionary global tax regime. […] It is the starving of the public sector which has been pivotal in America no longer being the land of opportunity – with a child's life prospects more dependent on the income and education of its parents than in other advanced countries.

"Nay, Heaven forbid, indeed," quoth Robin, "that I should take from such as thee, jolly fellow! Not so much as one farthing would I take from thee, for I love a fair Saxon face like thine right well—more especially when it cometh from Locksley Town, and most especially when the man that owneth it is to marry a bonny lass on Thursday next. But come, tell me for what price thou wilt sell me all of thy meat and thy horse and cart."

Some years ago I was talking to a ten-year-old boy who had been to the Rodeo. He was a lad whom most casual observers would readily have called tough.
I'm a man past his prime who's been to the rodeo and back, as they say. I've been an actor, a bartender, a maitre d', and a hustler, without much success at any of them.
I was one of the few graduating privates promoted from Army class El to E-2. To paraphrase Joan Crawford, I'd been to the rodeo and survived.
Some seemed bored and irritated by the priapic yahooism and overwillingness of peers to read a sexual double entendre into the most innocuous remark. "No matter what you say," said one student, "someone is going to respond with ‘That's what she said.’ "
So this morning we pulled up a pumpkin-pancake recipe on the kitchen laptop. Just one problem: My wife couldn't read it from where she was mixing. "Can't you make it bigger?" she asked. (Go ahead, insert your own "that's what she said" joke here. No class.)
A respectable divine like Samual Torshell sold the pass when he wrote in 1645 that there was no difference between men and women in the state of grace.
In fact the officials in the Richmond Asylum had pre-empted Sinn Féin. They managed to sell the pass without losing their jobs in the process, unlike Henry Campbell or John Flood.

It won't be remembered as a classic in the pantheon of great South Wales derbies, but nobody on the Cardiff City side of the divide will care as their team secured the first ever set of Premier League bragging rights in the Welsh capital.
Worth as much as $900 million, he estimates, the author clearly thinks he has earned bragging rights, and he intends to exercise them.
The husband himself (called "he" to emphasize his role as Typical Male) comes across as a rather dense, naughty adolescent boy. He is clearly suffering from a terminal case of the Peter Pan syndrome.

Mayor, alderman, park board president. Teacher, coach, athletic director. U.S. Air Force tail gunner and aviator. Pro football player and collegiate wrestler. [ … ] As a longtime observer of the Waukegan scene once joked — with respect — a guy like Richard Hyde "knows where the bodies are buried."
The film didn't interest me much, but I suppose it had its moments.
After spending the night resting in an abandoned church, the group decided to move on in their quest.
Moving on again, I catch another GWR Class 802 bound for Oxford via the Cotswold Line.
The best revenge is always to just happily move on and let karma do the rest.
Don't listen to him; he's telling tales.
"Billionaire Johann Rupert has called on politicians to play the ball and not the man in his acceptance of the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Lifetime Achievement Award... “Why attack people instead of debating the issue? Our issues are unemployment and a terrible educational system. It is a disaster,” said Rupert."
The NFL renaissance of Doug Flutie is a reminder of one of the great plays in college football history. [ … ] "The play was called 'Trips Right, Flood Tip,'" Phelan said. "That meant three receivers to the right side, flood the zone and try for the tip."
McCarthy could spot his curveball for strikes, and flooded the zone with fastballs and cutters.
While Washington should flood the zone with research funding, it should refrain from trying to pick a winner.
[A]s former Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon so eloquently puts it — “the real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with sh–.”
The coach had to charge up his players with a powerful speech before the final.
As he spoke the plan became in focus.
The abbreviation CIA stands for "Central Intelligence Agency".
Some teachers festoon every spare inch of wall with vocabulary choices or maths techniques to use, which look great at first, but to some children might appear quite daunting. You'll probably see unfamiliar acronyms such as Walt (We Are Learning To). Be sure to ask what they stand for and how they are used in practice.
whether these names do not some of them sometimes stand for the same thing
For the most part, he has some knack, or trick of the trade, which by close inspection can be delected, and so the heart of his mystery be seen into.
There is no trick of the trade which he does not know, no artifice which he does not which he does not habitually practise.
Most customers won't notice this trick of the trade, since the part is not sat upon.
More than a few of the 3,000 members of the National Association of Manufacturers, gathered for their annual convention in Manhattan's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel last week, felt like small boys worrying about a trip to the woodshed. None knew how vindictive or friendly toward business the Truman Administration would be.
And they lived happily ever after.
And at three o'clock this afternoon: Eureka! He had it in his hand, a flimsy brown file plucked from the catacombs of the public prosecutor's office. It was marked for destruction but by a miracle had escaped the flames. Bachmann had once more made the weather.
Winston Churchill recalled Joseph Chamberlain as "incomparably the most live, sparkling, insurgent, compulsive figure in British affairs" at the end of the nineteenth century. He was "the one", said Churchill, "who made the weather".
"You cannot get away from the fact that they have made the weather, politically, on two issues, on forcing the referendum and on the question of migration," he said. "They’ve had more of an influence than you would expect from a party that only won one parliamentary election."
The railway underpass in the town centre has been called Tickle Cock by locals for at least a century and dates back to Victorian times. It is thought the name refers to a "monkey run" where the lads and lasses of Castleford did their courting ... He added: "It dates back to the late 19th Century or early 20th Century and would function in the same way as any monkey run where you paraded up and down trying to find a boyfriend or girlfriend."
He finally came down from his post-bonus high.
In the middle of the night, it feels alright / But then tomorrow morning / Ooh, ooh, then you come down
You're meant to wash up after yourselves, don't leave it for me.
In 1967, a Shulgin compound called DOM enjoyed a brief vogue in Haight-Ashbury under the name STP, at doses several times larger than those at which Shulgin had found significant psychoactive effects, and emergency rooms saw a spike in the number of people coming in thinking they would never come down.
The young man's lucky star shone full on him, and dazzled him to a seeming indiscretion.
If exiled, he went without remonstrance, confident that his lucky star would again lead him to the front, and with fertile brain every ready to plan a revolution or arrange a coup d'état.
When I have completed a manuscript, if I lay it away in a drawer or pigeon-hole, it lies there quietly enough, and my mind seems wholly discharged of it. But if I mail it, I straightaway find myself tormented with "staircase wit" in the shape of emendations.
So-called Staircase Wit is another example, where we key ourselves up for an important event — an interview, say, or a date — rehearsing how we are going to present ourselves and what we are going to say. Then afterwards we lie awake thinking of all the witty, intelligent, charming things we should have done and said, and didn't because we were so busy trying to remember and revise the plan. . . .
One of the most insightful thinkers I know, the computer entrepreneur Yossi Vardi, prompted me to summarize "my idea" while standing on one leg. It was not too convenient to stand one one leg after a few glasses of perfumed Riesling, so I failed in my improvisation. The next day I experienced staircase wit.
Please bear with me a moment while I connect you to his office.
Uncle Tom's study was a place I seldom entered during my visits to Brinkley Court, because when I did go there he always grabbed me and started to talk about old silver, whereas if he caught me in the open he often touched on other topics, and the way I looked at it was that there was no sense in sticking one's neck out. It was more than a year since I had been inside this sanctum …
A “hood,” he said, isn’t necessarily a neighborhood, adding that the same culture is seen on Wall Street, “where the 11th commandment is ‘Thou shalt not get caught.’ ”
2005 September, “Dome sale 'was like a lucky dip'”, in BBC News‎:
My father found me a nuisance, and put me through the mill, and I can never forget it particularly the evenings.
If you're going through hell, keep going! —Anonymous
He seemed to vanish into thin air.
Stephen Hawking is a leading light in physics, people say he's the greatest physicist since Einstein.
The actress, 31, also pooh-poohs the notion that she's robbing the cradle with Timberlake, 22.
They were ordered to the field, and their places filled by the Georgia "Reserves," an organization of boys under, and men over the military age. As General Grant aptly-phrased it, "They had robbed the cradle and the grave," in forming these regiments.
From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, 't is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here's stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.
It doesn't matter which party it is. If the people choose one, a Democrat, then so be it.
Alright, troops, line up and move out!
We must move out before the end of the month or we'll be paying extra rent.
“We must not submit,” said Mr. Eager. “I knew he was trying it on. He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.”
The Arabs hate the French more than they hate us. Having more reason to do so, they are more polite; in other words, they have learnt not to try it on, when they meet a European.
“ [ … ] Tell her I’ll be outside the house from eleven o’clock onwards. Tell her to leave the morning-room window open and to switch on the light in her bedroom when it’s safe for me to come in.” “She won’t believe me if I go and tell her that,” I said. “No girl would. She’d think I was trying it on.”
Don't let [presidential press secretary Ron] Ziegler shoot off at the mouth without our knowledge.
The train will not be arriving any time soon.
Southgate's first choice defenders have not proved reliable against international opposition of the highest quality - and produced no evidence here to suggest they will do so any time soon.
I saw, though he tried to conceal it, that he was very much hurt at your behaviour, and I was sure, by his looks, that he did not think my jealous apprehension groundless; however, he protested he did, and persuaded me not to make a scene by arriving her in the middle of the night [ … ]
The next time I saw Miss Churm after this incident she surprised me greatly by making a scene about it—she accused me of having wished to humiliate her.
She snuggled against me, while from the other side a boy was amateurishly trying to pick my pocket. I opened my mouth to protest, but thought better of it. Why make a scene at the end of such an enjoyable evening?
This time I had really hurt my son. Youqing wasn’t upset because I had hit him, but because I had made a scene in front of so many of his teachers and classmates.
Tony Blair insists on remaining in office well past his sell-by date - yet he can afford to go.
Manifold: This is not a team, Petey. This is just another mass grave., Ewin: Eeew. What's the sell-by date on that manifold? I think it's gone bad.
"They have gone past their sell-by date. But the fitters have done an amazing job keeping these units running for as long as they have.
From Nikko northwards my route was altogether off the beaten track, and had never been traversed in its entirety by any European. I lived among the Japanese, and saw their mode of living in regions unaffected by European contact.
It is not the author's purpose to dwell on famous attractions, but rather to go off the beaten track, and frequently the tourist is encouraged to leave the car and explore the surrounding country on foot.
The search for authenticity arguably motivates backpackers to travel off the beaten track in search of areas not yet contaminated by tourists or other backpackers.
“Click on everything including graphics, buttons, and links, to see where they lead. Don't be afraid to get lost, and don't worry about making mistakes. 'You can't break the Internet,' says Warren Shaver, project manager for ASTD Online Services.”
You shouldn't swim on a full stomach.
“Obviously, Kim isn’t the first person to claim to ’break the Internet.’ In September Taylor Swift “broke the Internet” when she wore a T-shirt saying ’no it’s Becky,’ a super-meta reference to a Tumblr post where a user insisted that a picture of young Taylor was, in fact, someone named Becky. Beyoncé’s surprise album ’broke the Internet’ when she secretly released it last year. Alex from Target ’broke the Internet’ just by looking cute at work. Even Obama’s sensationally tan suit was almost able (but not quite) to ’break the Internet,’ according to Shape magazine.”
What's eating him? I've never seen him this worked up over anything before.
Their names all sounded the same to me at first, and I had trouble keeping straight who was who.
Doing that again will put your job in the toilet.
Patients with white coat hypertension did not show a generalized increase of blood pressure lability, nor an exaggerated pressor response while at work. . . . In such patients, the pressor response may be relatively specific to the physician's office and lead to significant misclassification of hypertension.
Of course there is the self-righteous minority convinced that while they may not be perfect, they are pretty close. It is best to avoid these people altogether. They are no fun at parties and, for the most part, are generally irritating the rest of the time.
Serious inductive philosophers are also no fun at parties because they are like little experience-sponges, constantly soaking up new information for their pet thesis.
We need an investor with deep pockets to help us get our invention to market.
Out of deep pockets in three weeks flowed 18 six-figure gifts totaling $3,100,000.
It is commonly claimed that juries award plaintiffs who sue corporations larger sums of money because the jurors believe that the corporations, with their "deep pockets," can afford more.
The federal government was the one party with the deep pockets to meet the rent-seeking needs of insurers and high-risk property owners.
"[T]he national campaign took the low road in too many cases instead of the high road. On the high road would've been the urban agenda. On the low road all we had was personal vilification."
Burger King and Hardee's took the low road, heavily promoting gut-busting sandwiches like the Enormous Omelet and the Monster Thickburger.
The high road of public service and the low road of political advantage seem inextricably intertwined.
The remodelling of the second floor will be fixed-price, but the repair work has to be on a time and material basis.
Fifty thousand men cannot easily steal a march over the sea.
She yesterday wanted to steal a march of poor Liddy.
He enjoyed the idea of stealing a march on society, and seeing the sons he had left at such a disadvantage behind him, ruffling it, in spite of absurd law, with the foolish best.
They stole a march by taking non-merchandise inventory on January 2.
In the morning he stole a march on the sun, for he had finished breakfast when its first rays caught him.

This very morning we begin rebuilding the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain or shine.
When the boss wasn't around on the weekend they would sometimes screw off.
On account of the high rate of wages at Sydney, stevedores will not "screw off" now so willingly as they did formerly.
I finished the work early so I screwed off.
I said no. Now screw off!
"We just won a new car!" "Screw off! You're joking, right?"
Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.
As the 1857 to Manchester Piccadilly rolls in, I scan the windows and realise there are plenty of spare seats, so I hop aboard. The train is a '221'+'220' combo to allow for social distancing - a luxury on an XC train as normally you're playing sardines, so I make the most of it.
Once I was lost in darkness, but now I have seen the light.
I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin I wouldn't let my Dear Saviour in Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night Praise the Lord. I saw the light.
Finally, near the end of the meeting, John saw the light and withdrew his objections.
His book never saw the light.
I've been running about all week getting everything ready for the holidays.
AFL grand final day is the best day of the year by the length of the Flemington straight.
The Orthodox consider the bishop of Rome to have always been merely a first among equals.
I wonder whether Margaret Thatcher, Harold Macmillan, Winston Churchill, Lloyd George, Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone (going back in time) thought of themselves as mere firsts among equals.
He succeeded effortlessly, without breaking a sweat.
Consider, for instance, that Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Marat Safin and even the supposedly out-of-sorts Lleyton Hewitt all won the opening set of their first-round matches 6-0 before barely breaking a sweat in the two sets that followed.
I shrugged and said, “There's nothing to tell. I put foot to ass when need be, protect Jon from people that try to fuck her over without grease, and I love to have fun from time to time.”
I'll be right back, but I've got to go to see a man about a dog.
Whenever I'm upset, I look to Mary to cheer me up.
He thoroughly cleaned his silver watch-chain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his boots, looked to the brass eyelet-holes, went to the inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking-stick, and trimmed it vigorously on his way back; [ … ].

If you are treated ill and put on, ’Tis natural to make a Fuss; To see it and not care a Button, Is just as natural for us.
"His statement is wholly false," was our hero’s reply. "It was his miserable villainy that deprived me of my liberty, and kept me away from my work." Mr. Goldwin looked puzzled. "The plot thickens," said he. "Give me your story."

Twenty years since we sat on top Of the world, amusing ourselves and sneering At other manners and customs, jeering At other nations, living in clover— Not any more. That’s done and over. No one nowadays cares a button For the upper classes—they’re dead as mutton.

“The devil is a liar! It ain't that damn bad! Don't even go there Jay”, says Teresa closing the bathroom door.
I reached into my hand bag for the court papers and held them towards him, he took them from my hand and looked at them with contempt and handed back to me and said, The devil is a liar, this divorce proceeding shall not stand neither shall it come to pass.
“Lazarus? Our Lazarus? This can't be!” Legion huffed angrily and shouted, “The devil is a liar!”
The official report runs to several thousand pages in 12 volumes.
I became sick at heart. My countenance was painted with the hues of ill health and vexation.
The repairs ran to 1,200 euros.
Sick at heart and oppressed with his feeling of loneliness and impotence, he could only look at her in speechless misery.
So we weep for two or three years more, very quietly, and then one day, too sick at heart, we die, with no fuss, leaving as little trace on earth as a bird's flight across the sky.
My musical tastes don't run to Wagner, I'm afraid.
I think my carpentry should run to making a window.
I can tell you do not give a rip about me or my opinions.
It is somewhat remarkable that none of bishop Ridley’s sermons have come down to us.
There is some confusion about this work since the original has disappeared, and scholars have assumed that what has come down to us is not by Mozart.
As you’ll have noticed, a large number of pre-Renaissance writings on language have come down to us without any indication of their author’s name, or with a false one attached.
Once I had a love and it was a gas / Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Anyway, long story short, I totally screwed up today.
Sitting on a park bench / Years away from fighting / Ah, to cut a long story short, I lost my mind
So anyway, long story short . . . Kenny was always gambling. And six years ago, he bought this lottery ticket and he won. Not much. A million bucks. After taxes, that’s like five hundred thousand dollars. I’m thinking party time.
[ … ] a hissing hot fever laid hold of him; and the doctors, with all their rank and file of phials and bolusses, could hardly drive him out of his veins.
“So long story short,” Damon continues, obviously enjoying his newfound status as Magic Kingdom iconoclast, “it got back to the director what I did and then it went all the way to [Michael] Eisner’s office. [ … ]”
When a man has lived in such hissing hot places that he is fain to spend his life under cover, he is glad to keep abroad in this green English sweetness.
Long story short, I'm on the hook for sending Trong Tri Kelso to college and he doesn't want to go to a state school.
None of the Pontifexes were deficient in good looks; they were a well-grown shapely family enough, but Alethea was the flower of the flock even as regards good looks, while in respect of all other qualities that make a woman lovable, it seemed as though the stock that had been intended for the three daughters
"Certainly, sir, that will be an excellent method of trial.", "Ay, ay, know the way! soon find if they are above par. Be sure don't mind gold waistcoats; nothing but tinsel, all shew and no substance; better leave the matter to me; take care of you myself; know where to find one will do."
The engine is working up to par now.
His work isn't up to par. Is he not well?
[W]e are concerned that outright harassment such as being called nigger, jungle bunny, porch monkey, boy, son, etc., is occurring entirely too much.
Look Jake, you need a real partner, you know what I mean, a real white partner, not that overweight porch monkey. . . ; we whites have to stick together.
There are things some people might wish to alter about [the restaurant] Die Jägerhütte (for myself, they could play the same tape for months and I still wouldn't slap a thigh).
I married a man much like my controlling stepfather. We tend to play the same tape until we see who we are.
All they do in church is play the same tape over and over. I could recite that stuff by heart.
We met a staff member, Pat, from Senator Dole's office first.... We had our message clear and crisp. We gave a couple of examples... . We indicated... . We talked about... . We thanked Pat and, as we walked to Senator Burr's office, congratulated each other... . We had a very good meeting with John from Senator Burr's office and played the same tape from our earlier meeting.
Mr. Matthews, usually nonjudgmental when writing about O'Connor's domestic relations, can't resist calling him "the king of the castle, the smug possessor of a bevy of three fine women absolutely de-voted to him."
Darren Clarke's impressive victory on Sunday at Montecastillo in the Volvo Masters, the season's finale, was good enough to leapfrog Lee Westwood into second place on the order of merit, but not to dislodge Monty as the king of the castle.
Wainwright, who is composing the music, is partnered with Daniel MacIvor, who is writing the libretto. “Both Daniel and I are used to being king of the castle,” Rufus confides, “so we need a third party to give us a sense of perspective.”
They informed us that the cause of her committing this rash deed was a dispute with her mistress, but on further inquiry it appears that Cupid had a finger in the pie.
The Foundation had, however, decided to keep a finger in the pie and to pay its share in the running costs of the school.
The whole ball of wax will be viewed in 5 minutes.
In my opinion the whole ball of wax depends on what she'll say.
Of course I have to take a little advantage. After all, I'm the guy who puts the thing together—the whole ball of wax.
What's the butcher's bill?
We've got pots, pans, the food and cooking utensils—the whole ball of wax.
So the Harvard diploma is now, more than ever, a golden ticket to a certain kind of success.
The shiny brass trumpet that Pop bought was his golden ticket out of Poorville and onto the streets of the three F's Fame, Fortune and Freedom.
A staffer handed me the coveted golden ticket, indicating that I had been invited to Hollywood, and I danced out the door.
He has a class on Thursday afternoons, but he skipped out this week.
We'll try a dummy run with a small group first, to check that it works correctly.

The kids are sacked out in the back seat.
There are honourable people in the government and principled advisers working in Number 10, even if their unheralded service is obscured by the crass antics of spin doctors and the demagoguery of some ministers.
Dave! Long time no hear! How has Boston been treating you?
These shirts are very expensive. Mind you, they are excellent quality.
Given any remote chance to gun down an effective spokesman for conservative economics as a secret fascist and torturer, even Nobel laureates can, we see, succumb to an itchy trigger finger.
They all have an itchy trigger finger when it comes to advertising.
Under these kinds of circumstances, players with significant exposure, tight stops, and itchy trigger fingers can end up overreacting to what is essentially noise.
Look at Afghanistan and Iraq, it's plain to see that our current President has an itchy trigger finger.
The good fortune which attended him throughout life may have been partly owing to this cause as well as to his undoubted valour, for though he never lost a battle, nothing is more astounding than his imprudence and the easy confidence with which he trusted Somerset, Warwick, Montague, and others, all the while they were betraying him.
Sulla, encamped near Scipio, and amusing him with caresses under pretence of an approaching peace, was all the while corrupting his troops.
All the while, my intention was to amuse her, and divert her out of her hellish thoughts, and show to her the wide world of which she could now be a part.
She won't be going out much, as she's beavering away on her thesis.
The most obvious impact of the strike was the “havoc” created at Glasgow and London’s Heathrow airports by striking air traffic controllers (who joined the strike in solidarity and are not themselves directly involved in the dispute). But quietly and without fuss, thousands of scientists normally beavering away in seclusion downed microscopes, test tubes, and oscilloscopes.
One of a hundred a year, or so, is all I wish:—I would not be at the plague of paying land-tax for a larger.
I was thinking more of the tendency today for people to develop whole areas of mathematics on their own, in a rather abstract fashion. They just go on beavering away.
On the other side there was a floor to ceiling partition, on which the mining share prices and dealing boards were fixed, separating the mining sales desk from the specialist mining research group who beavered away behind the partition.
These enterprises some of which are still under construction, or are still "gestating" or having "teething trouble", employ well over 5,53,600^([sic]) persons.
You will have to develop that industry. You cannot have teething trouble, all the time. What is this teething trouble, I am not able to understand. [ … ] In the name of teething trouble, in the name of protection, they enjoy the concessions at the cost of the consumers and also at the cost of the workers.
Even in its moderate form, this argument presupposes that factual elements can be plucked out of panegyric as nuggets of truth isolated from the dross of empty verbiage.
This book identifies twelve teachings that sound plausible because they each contain a nugget of truth.
Unfortunately, there is a nugget of truth to the notion of black and Hispanic tensions but, like politics, the friction tends to be very local.
Can you call me back tomorrow, mate? I′m flat strap at the moment.
It is very like the philosophy that opens and closes Yojimbo—that a long life living on gruel in the country is better than short life of living it up in city.
Just as any grandmother or grandfather will tell you that their best days were spent during the Depression, anyone who was 18 and living it up in 1968 will tell you they spent their better days at this time.
Is there something the matter with him?
There is nothing the matter.
Is much the matter with the old plan?
During the seventies, Shashi Kapoor went into fourth gear in Bollywood, while Merchant and Ivory made a slew of films, many of which were not set in India.
After all, he did the very same thing, pool and lunch, every Friday afternoon for five months—Friday perfect because it gave his cock a rest before the weekend, when it went into fourth gear.
I lost my dad right about your age. So I know what you're goin' through. So if you wanna come in and talk, or you just want somebody to spill your guts to, or you just wanna throw the bull around, door’s open.
This Subaru station wagon was as homely as a hedge fence and cramped as a corn crib, but it was the immediate hit of every ski town in the country.
[I]t was only a question of time, after all, when the forgery would be discovered. [ … ] "Somewhere along the line that check has been stolen and raised to twenty-five thousand dollars," he remarked.
"I think it is quite obvious," he said, "that the current atomic-arms race can not go on forever. Somewhere along the line ... we will have acquired all the weapons we would possibly need."
Somewhere along the line, Christmas became the year's fattest festival. It lost its already tenuous association with the sacred and became a wham-bam, all-u-can-eat, deep-fill stufferama.
Congress has the power of the purse and can choose not to pay for a Presidential policy with which they disagree.
Joseph Michael Valachi looks a bit like a Damon Runyon gangster—the tough guy who really is all heart.
Greyhounds in general are all heart, kind and gentle souls that love to please and be with their owners.
That performance was off the chain!, Who are you telling?
But what puts me down for the count is the action of the fellow. Never showed up; just made her miss two performances.
But every time the music world thought it was down for the count, the orchestra has managed to rise again.
So, while Europe is still groggy and the U.S. is just starting to show signs of a pulse (and Japan of course is still down for the count), little Korea will grow anywhere from 3.2% to 6% this year.
"He's proved himself as a handy wingman and forward at VFL level and I'm sure he'll be banging down the door for senior selection next year."

Nobody used to care when players such as John Ferguson, Bobby Orr, Gordie Howe and Maurice Richard dropped the gloves, because they could play the game, too.
But Bradley, who dropped the gloves on Gore in a combative debate Wednesday night and called the vice president chronically dishonest, ignored Sullivan's advice.
For fudge's sake, mate! Stop shooting at me!
Some of the birds on this ship took me for a sucker and tried to make a rummy out of me but I was wise to their game and I guess the shoe is on the other foot this time.
As handsome a gentleman, to be sure, as ever trod shoe leather! I wonder that old folks can be so very, very blind!

"Pooh!" said Jerry, throwing out his chest, "I guess I can take care of myself without being tied to my mother's apron strings!"
It was clear she had a hand in this.
[ … ] Without men on the ground, we'll be pounding sand."
Can't say we'd be best pleased if the terrifying sound of explosives was going on underneath our bedroom window, but the assembled crowd seem to enjoy it.
He told Shelton we needed to "unleash holy hell." “We're not just going to pound sand,” he added.
The price to us was going to be $3 million, and we had four months to pay before the Licensing 6.0 deadline. We told Microsoft to go pound sand.
Yet had I scarce set foot in the passage when I stopped, remembering how once already this same evening I had played the coward, and run home scared with my own fears.
After the boat capsized, I thought that I would never set foot on dry land again.
Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit?
"Personally, I wouldn't be making jokes if I were sitting on drugs and weapons charges, but that's just me."
The newcomers often bring an array of ancillary problems to meetings, including emotional trauma and addiction to other drugs. As the organization metamorphoses, its supporters wonder whether A.A. [Alcoholics Anonymous] can or should be such a big tent.
They are not a slice of Americana, as we usually say, but rather, a broad brush of it. While most of our successful sports franchises display some distinct personality, only the Cowboys offer the big tent.
And here in essence is the problem with the Democrats’ big tent, as well as the grounds for a wholly new kind of culture war that is probably going to make us long for the clear lines and simple enmities of the old one.
A patriotic virago, armed with a brace of pistols, enacted prodigies; and a young man, who distinguished himself in a remarkable manner, has since proved to be of the gentle sex.
The acquiescence of the party as the result of hasty and immature deliberation, is indicative of a supreme contempt of comrades, and vitiates in one foul swoop the conditions that regulate the movement.
I need to get it all out at once, inflicting the damage in one foul swoop before facing the fallout left in my wake.
The chairman sat on the report until the end of the legislative session.
He started to act up, but she sat on him.
I sent the boss my proposal three weeks ago and he's been just sitting on it.
Logic is nothing other than methods we have learned that keep thinking on the rails.
Menin Road got the offensive back on the rails but conditions, which had been deplorable before, favoured the outcome.
