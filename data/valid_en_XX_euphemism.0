Males try to hold females during copulation with primarily the posterior legs, so this makes sense for the positioning of the both morphotypes at males and females.

When grown under favorable conditions, hemp is very competitive with weeds, and no herbicides are generally used in fiber hemp production. Many authors have commented on the exceptional ability of hemp to suppress weed populations (Dewey, 1901 and 1913; Robinson, 1935; Dempsey, 1975, Van der Werf, 1991). Weed suppression with minimal pesticide use is potentially one of the greatest agronomic and environmental benefits of growing hemp in rotation with other crops.

The remarkable Romanesque churches that are the pride of my country, churches that date back to the foundation of the Principality in the late thirteenth century and that loomed over the villages for almost a millennium, are now hemmed in by concrete buildings- stores, apartments, houses, the same buildings you might find in parts of Rio de Janeiro, Beijing or New York
Even the lowliest web intern was hired in some small way to be an agent of change, and anyone tasked with making changes is in for a rough ride. At one job a few years ago, I was alternately cheered for blazing trails, scolded for being too deliberate, and patted on the head for expecting too much. And it wasn't easy to predict which reaction I would get. 
How can mere airport regs authorize-- nay, mandate!-- male stranger upon female stranger attractive part-touching just because, for example, TSA may short handed on female employees ( many small airports? )-- instead of merely refusing boarding of same ( crackpot but not criminal )? ****** Both same-sex naked viewing and same-sex private part touching conflict with the justification previously cited by courts for okaying so-called administrative ( warrant-less ) searches: relatively limited invasion of privacy ( sobriety checkpoints as far as it's been stretched ).

And the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts?
It wasn?? t a question of whether he and his wife were going to divorce?? the relationship was toxic, the lawyers were in place, it was definitely over. The real concern was whether this guy needed time and space after the demise of his marriage. He assured my client that he didn?? t. 
Don't make them desert sands, or seemingly endless slicks of oil that kill our oceans and entire ecosystems. A conscientious custodian of the environment is one of whom it will be said, "He must have been a gardener who cared a lot, who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop. Strange, though, how one little " insect " can damage so much " grain."

"Well, I guess that's just a preview of what I should be expecting, huh?", He said, looking over at his mother, who was simply shrugging as she turned a page in her book. "I mean...

Just as man, by such precepts, impresses a kind of inward principle of actions on whoever is subject to him, so God imprints on the whole of nature the principles of his own proper actions, and thus he is said to command all of nature. As the psalmist says, "He has made a decree which will not pass away" (Ps. 148:6). For this reason all the movements and activities of nature are subject to eternal law.

But physicists still rely on journals for certification. People pay more attention to papers which come out in Physical Review Letters, or even just Physical Review E, than ones which are only on Arxiv. "Could it make it past peer review?" is used by many people as a filter to weed out the stuff which is too wrong or too unimportant to bother with. This doesn't work so well for those directly concerned with a particular research topic, but if something is only peripherally of interest, it makes a lot of sense. 
For everyone else, variables like stressful events or happy occasions or even day of the week are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month, and this is the information the scientific community has had since the 1990s.

"BrendanO'Leary asks all Americans, whether they supported or opposed the Iraq war, to think very carefully about getting out.

I can accept the idea of "no recordings at the polling place," by the way, because that protects other voters from being "outed" and self-reporting is collateral damage for a far more important principle. But to focus on the self-reporting is just stupid and sounds like another excuse for voter suppression.

So maybe it's Thanksgiving after all!

As the previous case shows, the frontal lobes of the brain play an important role in initiating behavior, and this function can be disabled if they are damaged. However, the evidence shows that the frontal lobes play an equally important part in inhibiting behavior, and this function can also be disabled by frontal lobe damage.

Bright students are bored by material that lacks intellectual challenge and by group work that constantly sets them up as tutors to less able students. Expecting a single teacher in an elementary classroom to be all things to all students is not realistic. Therefore, i believe there should be more specialization even at the lower levels, so that the individualized lessons needed to meet all students' needs in each subject could be developed by a specialist who only prepares for his or her subject not all subjects every day. 
You want proof of some real stupidity? Tell me a race of folk who decided one fine day to make a homeland right inside the Arab heartland by force stealin all the native land and killin most of these guys and still they are expecting to be treated with peace.

Therefore did they rather choose for a season to suspend their assent unto the authority of the whole epistle than to prejudice the church by its admission. And well was it that some learned men afterward, by their sober interpretations of the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto the errors of the Novatians; for without this it is much to be feared that some would have preferred their interest in their present controversy before the authority of it: which would, in the issue, have proved ruinous to the truth itself; for the epistle, being designed of God unto the common edification of the church, would have at length prevailed, whatever sense men, through their prejudices and ignorance, should put upon any passages of it. But this controversy is long since buried, the generality of the churches in the world being sufficiently remote from that which was truly the mistake of the Novatians; yea, the most of them do bear peaceably in their communion, without the least exercise of gospel discipline towards them, such persons as concerning whom the dispute was of old, whether they should ever in this world be admitted into the communion of the church, although upon their open and professed repentance. 
Concentrating on rogues first and foremost could create the false sense that deeper problems are being resolved. Regime change may be more satisfying than long-term statecraft; it is certainly more telegenic. But unless the United States and its principal partners engage proactively to prevent and contain state failure, rogue regimes may seize power in additional failed or failing states, raising the specter of fresh adversaries that seek wmd and harbor terrorists. 
@@4003541 THE GROWING INFLUX of immigrants that troubled America's elite in the early twentieth century gave rise to a movement to assimilate the newcomers as quickly as possible. 1 Several characteristics of the new immigrants disturbed native-born Americans.
