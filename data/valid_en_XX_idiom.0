First of all it was very early in the morning—it was about by this time between 4 and 6 a.m. everybody still asleep—so I went on and start push biking around the house till I decide that its not too early.

The master-cook began his career with apprenticeship at the lowest level, as a child of the kitchen, where he was subject to harsh discipline: as Olivier de la Marche points out, the master-cook's ladle was for hitting the children as well as for tasting sauces. Careers were often slow: in the French royal kitchens, Jean Jart was a child of the kitchen in 1386, and a master-cook only in 1418.
The Kitchen :—John Waleston, chief clerk; 8 others. John Cace, master cook; eleven others, with twelve children of the kitchen.

Farfetch'd is pretty good for a HM slave. And once you've visited everywhere, you can HM delete Cut and Flash and False Swipe and raise it to a decent level and watch it own damn near everything.
That leaves Flash, Waterfall, Fly, and (not a HM, but needed in much the same way) Rock Smash for another HM slave.
For this purpose, some players like to bring along a "HM Slave" (or two) - a Pokémon whose only purpose is to use HMs.
But during most phases of the breeding season, and especially in the peak when gobblers are henned up, it pays to get into the "buffer zone."
I told him about my plan, and he agreed that the gobblers must be henned up and that moving might be a good idea.
In him we discover the punctum saliens of a principle which is the master spirit of animal and vegetable motion, the ruling power of chemical science, the governing influence of atmospheric composition, the presiding genius of respiration, [ … ]
After some miles of country lanes he reached the high road, and as he turned into it and glanced along its white length, he saw approaching him a speck that turned into a dot and then into a blob, and then into something very familiar; and a double note of warning, only too well known, fell on his delighted ear.
Cities were not built to handle this volume of last-mile activity – a fact that firms such as UPS realise only too well.

[T]alent shows such as Ted Mack’s Original Amateur Hour, which was patterned on the 1930s Major Bowes’ Amateur Hour and Arthur Godfrey[’s] Talent Scouts,^([sic]) went on the air. In fact, that goes back to the days of vaudeville and beyond. The talent contests and amateur hours that go back centuries are in fact very much like America’s Got Talent.
We found this anonymous contribution to International Women's Year on a wall at Forest Lodge: "A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle." Apparently the first appearance of the phrase in print.
By 1962, well before the so-called "sexual revolution" or even the feminist slogan "a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle," Helen Gurley Brown could write in Sex and the Single Girl, "I think marriage is insurance for the worst years of your life.["]
"Where you goin'?" he called., "To git a wigwam for a goose's bridle!" yelled Smiley insolently, recalling one of the sayings of Granny McKinley, the oldest inhabitant.
When he wasn't at work he was usually off to see a man about a horse or to buy a wigwam for a goose's bridle. But he never brought the horse home like I asked him to, though we had a big enough backyard.
Hence we may apply an extended version of the Weierstrass-Lindemann theorem (cf. [37, p. 20]) to conclude that g(e", e*, e")=0 when h >0 is algebraic.
WHEN YOU do business with a man who is willing to sell himself, you musn't be surprised if you find that you have bought a gold brick.
In addition, that place became a haven for some of our drunks and gold bricks.
Spielberg's opinion relates well to the vision of high concept expressed by other Hollywood representatives: a striking, easily reducible narrative which also offers a high degree of marketability.
In their minds, he was the ultimate “gold brick” and“smart ass”—and they were right.
Teachers prefer true or false or multiple-choice tests because they can be graded so easily.
Stupid, ignorant, unsuspicious, trusting, it did not take long for this suave promoter to "gold brick" the poor widow of her little insurance money and the little savings of years.
Oh yes, I got plenty of good exercise all morning so decided to gold brick in the afternoon.
On second thoughts I don't think I will.
The stage came calling when a friend suggested he try out for a production of South Pacific. He got a part in the sailors' chorus and so began his acting career.
I'm having second thoughts about this party.

The Germans brought to the county not only their skills but customs that we still see followed throughout the area. Some of these were the celebrating of Bels Nichol or Kris Kringel on the eve of St. Nicholas' feast in December; …
Owls usually hunt at night.
In Germany, Santa has long been known as "Kriss Kringel" (derived from Christ Child). In America, the name is still used by the Pennsylvania Dutch.
This bus ride requires exact change.
‘Well, if that's what you want,’ he says, sounding a touch ratty, ‘I’ll stop everything else and you can have the entire A350 budget to turn up at the bookshop tomorrow.’ ‘Job's a good ’un,’ I tell him. ‘Oh, and one other thing. Cash, please.’
James Sutherland insists Australia had "no alternative" but to cancel the tour. "We have left no stone unturned in trying to ensure the tour could proceed as planned but at the end of the day the safety and security of our employees must come first."
Ellen Carnine fit that heroic profile. It did not jibe with her doing the Dutch.
The voter should take their absentee ballot to a post office, ask for a penalty envelope and mail it with the ballot inside.

He still persisted and, at that point, I guess, being born and raised in New York City, I had had enough of him and I said, 'Hey, you can go pound salt.'
They can read the ‘penny dreadful’, but they cannot darn their stockings or mend their shoes.
But instead of telling her to go pound salt, I realize, as Yogi Berra might say, you can hear a lot just by listening.
Even when she's already getting it from the front, she still takes it up the ass like a literal fucking champ.
...but I wouldn't want it taught from the textbook, because then the ordinary teacher would pound it into the pupils just as you would pound sand into a rathole, ...
Before we can even interest a bank in us we must prove where we stand and must show that we haven't been engaged in pounding sand into a rathole.
I said: ‘Let the prowl car pass up the hill. They'll think we moved over when we heard the siren.’
When Newsweek magazine ran a survey of fifty journalists, all of whom predicted Truman would lose, the president countered, "I know every one of those fifty fellows and not one of them has enough sense to pound sand into a rathole.”
Let all those that are suffering from any complaint or disease, and who are anxious to regain health and escape a wooden coat consult an experienced and successful practitioner
Each of us will want one, be he beggar, policeman, prince or boyar ; everyone, sooner or later, will parade in such a wooden coat.
The power to be a being of pure thought, the unlimited, unconstrained world of imagination, and we build a world of animated gifs, stupid sight gags, lame van-art avatars, stupid “playful” environments, and brain-dead flame wars augmented by animated emoticons that allowed participants to express their hackneyed ad hominems, concern-trollery, and Godwin's law violations through the media of cartoon animals and oversized genitals.
Welcome to Late Stage Capitalism: The Musical – the show formerly known as fashion week. Fashion week has never just been about fashion. It is a microcosm of everything that is compelling and seductive about modern life, and of everything that is terrifying about modern life as well.
His article urges people not to be “afraid” of being charged with confirming Godwin's law. But who would be afraid of that charge when you believe that the Nazi analogy is apt?
One more point, the aide says, also, this Arthur Zooks is not only the general's high-school classmate, but is a Very Important Person —in Feather Merchant circles.
"I think you're a goddamn feather merchant." When he saw that this had sort of stunned Lowell, he went on. "A word of advice, feather merchant: Don't try to take advantage of being the general's lady's golf pro and instructor in kraut."

Everybody who works for a feather merchant knows where all the trouble is — at higher headquarters. At least, that's what the feather merchant says.
Calling “Attention!,” our DI shouted, “That wasn't funny, you feather merchants!”
Jackson figured fat REMFs to be the worst kind of feather merchants.
The mayor said he doesn't want "feather merchants" to sell their products near schools.
The shortest, or the "Feather Merchants," as the smaller men were so inappropriately designated, brought up the rear.

Maury was a chow hound, and he knew everything and everybody in town.
Why would this shared history be so easily washed away? In her introduction, Colley directed us away from the notion that nations were characterised by cultural and ethnic homogeneity – of “blood and soil” – and towards Benedict Anderson’s definition of a nation as an “imagined community”
One type of water fear harbored by many youngsters is directly traceable to an unfortunate childhood experience.
This latter possibility seems particularly plausible from the perspective of the nonassociative model of water fear described previously.
Two days before the fight, the boxers weigh in with reporters watching.
We are not aware of any careful cross-cultural or developmental work showing that water fear is innate, however.
His trailer weighed in lighter than it should have. He might have a leak.
They had even hung fly paper but the flies did not go near it!
My wife Lara and I try to keep the doors and windows shut, and from the beams we hang dozens of fly papers, which quickly become covered in a revolting mass of struggling, sticky flies.
He weighs in at upwards of 250 pounds.
I searched up ghost people who knew what to do in a ghost case
If you were to search up the word happiness in a dictionary, your results would be something like "the state of being happy" or "joy".
So I spent a good couple of hours (it seems) in searching up some firewood, mostly wood chips and twigs, but I collected quite a pile.
So, there I am on a popular retail website searching up tiki torches and seriously, I'm like, Why are all these tiki torches sold out? . . . This is very strange. This was the Wednesday before Charlottesville.
One day the county put the word out that they was going to put down black top on the rock roads.
Maybe they will pass a bill requiring an investigation into just how much black top and concrete is used in the transportation system.
We won't black top your property for you because this is your own property, but we will loan you the money interest free if you will black top your driveway, providing you will give us another lease on that other 50 feet of land that you bought free.
As I look at the stacks of neatly folded linens, I see more than yard goods and thread.
The PWD will black top the road and immediately either the PHED or Power Corporation will dig up the road to lay pipes or cables.
Pap has taken the studs, and I have made up my mind to leave here for good and all.
She said, "When I was passing Wily B. Smiths," who was the hoot'n‑toot'n lad "Tanner" adopted, "the mule I was riding took the studs and began going backwards. Try as I did, it wouldn't budge forward."
The US dollar is worth considerably more than our South Pacific peso so exchange rates have to be carefully considered.
We might take some comfort from the fact that the US dollar also fell heavily against the pound, loonie, krona, real, kiwi and the usual “risk on” suspects but none of them outpaced the South Pacific peso.
Additionally, linguistic anthropology is one of the four subfields of anthropology, so my linganth tribe’s work overlaps, unsurprisingly, with the work of archaeologists, biological anthropologists, and, especially, social and cultural anthropologists
By the end of the century, the APS’s membership included the leaders of the American anthropological establishment, whose primary investigative interests were the ethnography, linguistics, archeology, and physical anthropology of the American Indian, within a theoretical structure that was essentially historical.
The following notes on the nasal index in Biological Anthropology have no pretension to perfection, exhibiting, as I am apprehensive they do, many faults of omission and commission,

Hughes takes a flutter on the nearest six, nickel bets on thirty-one to thirty-six.
Samoza has a long list of people who are personas non grata, and Figures suspects that I cannot get a visa to get into the country for this reason.
I was ridin' the horses then, you understand, and maybe known to take a flutter or two on the bangtails while I was about it.
The Doors became personas non grata. They couldn't get a gig.
In the next general election in 2007 the Liberals hung on to only a couple of these ridings: most of their voters took a flutter with the ADQ.
In time Getz took up the slack left by the dearth of commercial presenters and took a flutter on big-name artists in mid-career, often in the Orpheum.
His tragedy is an eloquent critique of Europe's leaders, diplomats, and intellectuals who were, again, about to unleash the dogs of war.
It became a practice on our side, at 10 o'clock each day, to turn all of these dogs of war loose upon the enemy for an hour or so.
The purpose of an educational visit was to tell the trader what the tax was and what he had to do [ … ]
Nor can they expect to rely on the lack of an educational visit from an officer of Customs and Excise. If everyone were able to rely on that it would be too easy a way out of getting the tax return wrong.
His patients, on the other hand, were precisely such people as recognized that without self-understanding, without direction, without health of the inner as of the outer man, life was not worth a wooden nickel.
I wouldn't be in your shoes for a wooden nickel.
Captain sure knew he was taking on two inexperienced greenhorns to round out the ship's full complement of eighteen men, officers and able seamen, and it wasn't costing him so much as a wooden nickel.
And we should not alter any word in the Scripture, which wholly is ministered unto us by the Ghost of God.
“Why,” Joe the Joker says, “the joke is, I will not be asleep in the sack, and my hands will not be tied, and in each of my hands I will have a John Roscoe, so when the sack is delivered to Frankie Ferocious and I pop out blasting away, can you not imagine his astonishment?”
While Hefzur was adjusting, conditions for the Rohingya in Myanmar, where his family was still living, were deteriorating. His parents described villages burning in the distance. They had to go, they informed him.
It was, by my watch, nearly an hour and a half from the time of our leaving the station before I heard the sound of the sea in the distance
So he takes the profit, which is the difference between the regulated transportation and the rate he has been able to pay to that gypsy truck.
The apparent one-to-one correspondence between comets and meteor showers raised a chicken or egg question which was not fully resolved until the middle of the twentieth century.
Fifty Short Shorts. An omnibus of entertaining short short stories by America’s favorite tellers of tales
Verga’s Wolf cannot but repeat her passions, Tolstoy’s Alyosha his passivity. Themes of obsession work especially well in this kind of short short.
Lawrence died defending his vessel and his famous last words, "Don't give up the ship," have been familiar to every schoolboy.
Edward Blamey and some of his friends had stuffed a toy cannon with powder and wadded newspapers, and they touched it off right in the middle of Judge J. T. Day's speech, and then they ran like whiteheads when they saw the constable coming . ran long and lightly and youthfully with their pockets filled with torpedoes and Chinese crackers and squibs . . . three cheers for the Red, White and Blue!
When Arria's husband was hesitating to kill himself, she stabbed herself with his dagger, to demonstrate to him how to accomplish a noble suicide. Her famous last words—Paete, non dolet ["Paetus, it does not hurt!"].
Holy Smokes! I was scairt. Then the train hit a curve so fast I had to fight like a whitehead to keep her from pitchin' me out.
When AC traction was being introduced this was recognised as a threat to track circuits. Harmonics of the switching frequency would appear in the traction return currents in the running rails and, potentially, this would cause wrong-side track circuit failures.
Says one Sperry product executive: "As a manager, there is almost nothing you can do to get fired here." Considering the new circumstances, those could be famous last words.
A similar bill was passed in 2012 to give permanent residency to a Nigerian student who sought to pursue a medical degree and continue receiving treatment for a rare genetic disorder that caused large facial tumors. It was the last time a “private bill” became law.
"But Nick—I'm never getting married again. I'm serious about that." "Famous last words."
Asbury Park held what was the earliest baby parade in New Jersey on July 22, 1890, with a band accompanying the marchers, Queen Titania and her court as judges, and a grand prize of a deluxe baby coach.
I taught the girls to hit the toy rattles that I tied over the hood of Juney's baby coach, so he heard the noise and tried to see what it was.
"Lindsey and Tess are both armed. And Stella and Robert are here. We're ridiculously safe." "Those sound like such famous last words," Dave said.
No one in the whole wide world is going to give a shit. Not one single person. And they won't even know anyway. Tomorrow you'll be in Syria or Egypt or Guantanamo Bay, even. We do things differently now.
Short shorts gained favor with women because of their comfort and because Bermuda models tend to emphasize the least attractive part of the legs—the knee and calf.
By last week, when Queen Juliana flew back from an Italian vacation to swear in new Prime Minister Victor Marijnen, the government had taken Dutch leave for 70 days.
Contemplating this scene while waiting for the bus home after a day of dreaming and lazing at the beach on "Dutch leave", Kwang Meng muses without any meaningful conclusion as to its larger continuing historical significance, "All these colonial names indelibly stamped everywhere. No wonder the English still feel very much at home here. They still cling on to their Cricket Club, Tanglin Club and Polo Club".
The barn goes down tomorrow, rain or shine, hell or high water, with your cooperation or without it.
All groups would demonstrate reductions in snake fear during treatment.
[ … ] it is meaningful to consider differences between high and low snake fear groups in general, rather than considering each separate measure of fear individually.
Intense snake fear is prevalent in both humans and other primates. Humans and monkeys learn snake fear more easily than fear of most other stimuli through direct or vicarious conditioning (Ohman and Mineka, 2003).
“I’m gettin’ me some implants … so I can get my Pamela Anderson on.” ¶ “I heard that, cause you know you belong to the itty bitty titty committee.”
My mother was hired out to a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles from old master's, and, being a field hand, she seldom had leisure, by day, for the performance of the journey.
TESSIO: Buon Natale, everybody. Buon Natale... (he smiles at Tom Hagen) Hi, Tom, how's every little thing?, HAGEN: (helping him with the presents) Wonderful, Sal.
Our relief at Paris was a mécanicien looking like a Darnall "Grinder" in his cloth cap with a button on top - and no goggles either.
A good weekly wage for a field hand on a banana plantation is $3.
Everyone is accustomed to taking time to do a "hot wash," which happens during the action, or a "cold wash," which is done immediately after the action is completed.
The single most popular AI technology identified in the report was computer vision. Audio (US) (file)
In the “hot wash” meeting after the exercise the participants agreed that cellular phones would be excluded from all future exercises and actual responses to prevent this limitation of information (Edwards and Goodrich, 2006).
Key postevent activities include debriefing, hot wash, and evaluation (USDHS, 2013).
Comparable worth aims to upgrade the wage scales for jobs that employ large numbers of women.
For rail freight, the key axis is through freight to and from Europe via the Channel Tunnel.
But the screenplay, from Supernatural creator Eric Kripke, diverts too often to inert scenes of Lewis’ struggles at school, and a subplot about his on-again, off-again friendship with bully Tarby Corrigan (Sunny Suljic) feels like a distraction from the magical business at hand.
I smiled back for him, thought about you, wondered what kind of night you were having, whether you had your wobbly boots on yet.
She'd be unsteady on her feet or, to put it Gayle's way, wearing wobbly boots.
By themselves, recognized components are not to be field-installed. They are intended for use in end-use products or systems that would ultimately be tested and listed [ … ]
One cannot lay a charge, a charge which has simply been sucked out of one's thumb, and then say that the onus rests on the person against whom the charge has been made, to prove that it is not so.
A raised symbol is placed on the dandy roll of the Fourdrinier machine and makes the paper thinner in that shape.
A shaded watermark is produced by a dandy roll located at or near the suction box on the Fourdrinier.
This man upon whose breast you lean too often has a jag on; he couldn't buy the raw benzine to run your chug-chug wagon !
Perhaps fuel may have been added to this flame of hatred by the fact that the editor does not own a chug-chug wagon and probably never will be able to do so but the feeling had its origin when as a pedestrian he had been obliged to resort to flight and the protection of a telephone pole in order to escape some charging gasoline demon or has nearly seen himself whisked to the hereafter by being run over by a machine while crossing the street.
The two cylinder chug wagon passed us safely at the top, and yet we lingered on enjoying the view.
Some of the girls had two chug wagons apiece. Money was no object.
She was denying herself skittles and beer, and putting up with tea and an old aunt, because she preferred the proprieties of life to its pleasures.
The men of the ARA were fond of repeating chief Cyril Quinn's line that life in the Russian mission was not all "skittles and beer."

there is what is called the race feeling, by which is meant the natural antipathy between races of different coloured skins—a feeling which, however manifestly unreasonable, is difficult to overcome.
He had also done a lot of Louis Deems' wet work, especially when it came to intimidating juries.
His race feeling is so strong that he seems to prefer Islam when taught by blacks to Christianity when brought by whites
Most of the time I clean with A.J. or another coworker, who vacuums while I do the wet work—bathrooms and kitchens.
There were no waiting rooms. … But there were licensed refreshment rooms, provided by those pioneers of station dining Messrs Spiers and Pond.
One day not met, yet, nor even on that street alone has been sighted, then a couple three days later after the fullness of fades, they go.
Complains of a bad taste in his mouth ; there is some sore throat and difficulty of deglutition ; appetite very bad ; not very thirsty[ … ].
The burning of a few heretics would be in principle no more repugnant to us than gagging; neither would a little Guy Fawkesing about Westminster, though the latter diversion might come home to honourable members disagreeably.
Some sore throat is a common symptom also in erysipelas of the scalp.
The barber being sure that all were on his side, now dropped his voice into tones sepulchral and solemn, and said slowly and deliberately; “If things don't mend, he must be Guy Fawkesed; Farmer Slade's barn was burnt by accident last Guy Fawkes' day; and no one ever found out who did it; and there's often a fire on Guy Fawkes' day; 'tis quite natural there should be when so many squibs are flying about."
With Jackson and Stuart alive, and with Davis and his cabinet, Hood, Daniel and the Pollards, all Guy Fawkesed at an early period of the conflict, what might not have been the result ?
I have a bit of sore throat.
Urban studies of cities other than Istanbul hardly existed until two decades ago. Though cities were frequently mentioned in historical studies about the socio-economic formation of the Ottoman Empire, the city itself was seldom the primary target of concern.
In June 2007, the American Medical Association (AMA) provided a clear-eyed assessment of a growing phenomenon: medical tourism. [ … ] Once relegated to facelifts and fat reduction, medical tourism has branched out into almost every kind of procedure, including bypass surgery, heart-valve replacement, angioplasty, knee reconstruction, and spinal fusion.
The failure of a new Brush 1,600 h.p. diesel on the down "Fenman" when it was conveying the Queen in a special saloon was an unfortunate piece of bad publicity for B.R.
After the war, the GWR restored its royal train, in reality special saloons provided for its directors and important guests, but the SR had finally discarded its ancient train, employing Pullman-cars where necessary.
Mise en place: Literally “put in place,” mise en place is the kitchen term for your setup, the gathering and preparation of all the tools and food you need to complete the task at hand. Mise en place can refer to a cook's organization on the line[ … ]
In the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry-makers to the sidewalk. The uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them, and upon the night air rose joyous cries, congratulations, laughter and unclassified noises born of McGary's oblations to the hymeneal scene.
I took aim and drew the trigger, but the gun missed fire. The person hearing the noise instantly jerked back his head.
So Hansen has released a Be on the Lookout For and this babe can't wait to drop the dime.
Sit on the hotel and hope he comes back, or put out a Be on the Lookout and rope in Nashville PD and the state police?
The gun-makers say, that the guns would be continually missing fire, if larger grained powder were adopted. This would be no fault of the powder, but theirs. Why not make the chamber wider, up to the immediate vicinity of the point of ignition?
The BOLO, she thought: a “Be On the Lookout” for Simon Childs was undoubtedly being sent out to every law enforcement agency in the United States.
In recent years there have been two fatalities and one near miss due to the inappropriate use of boom trucks.
Request that law enforcement put out a Be On the Look Out (BOLO) bulletin.
Immediately upon hanging up, he sent a “Be On the Look Out” notice for my vehicle to the BLM and Utah State Fish and Wildlife offices, then called a half-dozen of his personal acquaintances in those bureaus to follow up and make sure they received the action request.
Dean Chance ... wasn't crying over his near miss of a no-hitter Monday night.
A Be On The Lookout (BOLO) was issued and all members of law enforcement were actively looking for him.
Italy know they cannot wallow in the disappointment of last week's agonising near miss against Ireland.
The livers and lights of sheep, cattle, &c. were well boiled, chopped fine, seasoned with pepper and salt, and filled into the small intestines of those animals; and a piece from seven to nine inches long, sold to us for sixpence, York currency;

After several near misses, Van Persie finally reached three figures by turning in Walcott's cross before Jaaskelainen saved from Walcott when one-on-one.
D'ye hear me? I'll cut ye open. I'll cut the livers and lights out o'ye.
Then a blue button dashed to the box to pick up the call.
When the market closed at 3.30 pm, the entire jobbing community exited the Stock Exchange, walking in procession back to their offices, followed by a file of blue buttons struggling to carry cumbersome dealing books.

Now forced elsewhere, the cracker barrel crowd would quietly meet at night in private homes.
Generally speaking, the works of First Nations artists were made with materials such as wood, leather or cloth.
On February 17, 1956, the first one, No. 35018, left Eastleigh on its maiden run with a Bournemouth stopping train.
He’ll eagerly prosecute a pointless trade war against China, but when it comes to the millions in Hong Kong who are protesting China’s creeping despotism over their territory, Trump prefers to stay mum.
As “savages” become soldiers, and soldiers become social activists, the tribe has rapidly developed a First Nations identity as advocates of both stripes mobilize memories of past resistance in different contexts. Whether the state is green or blue, therefore, Taroko memories will continue to shape the relationship between state and tribe.
The best way to do this is to lay a flock bed on top of a straw bed.
First Nation leaders in Ontario will support demonstrations and protests, until six band councillors are released from jail.

Lying belly down, staying in one place, begin to experience gentle side-to-side rolling, with your head, torso and lower body moving all as one.
The bridge to allow access to such a gift is the lens of unity consciousness or seeing “all as one.”
The whole economy of this dance consists in turning round and round the room in a certain measured step ; and it is truly astonishing that this continued revolution does not set all their heads swimming like a top ; but I have been positively assured that it only occasions a gentle sensation which is marvellously agreeable.

After Cobb had consulted with the experts at Texas Tech in Lubbock to learn which strains of cotton were appropriate for his new land, and when his first fields were planted by tractor, broad and open and requiring no stoop work by imported Mexicans, he heard from the college expert the bests news of all: "This year Lubbock cotton is bringing in top dollar."
I had known these dirt-poor migrant workers so well frommy daysaccompanying them as they followed the harvests all over California– picking cotton in Corcoran, or doing back-breaking stoop work for ten cents an hour in the pea fields of Nipomo.
Had we no walking fire, Nor saucer-ey'd devil of these woods That led us ?
The famous champion, St. Andrew of Scotland, travelled through ayale of walking spirits, most fearful to behold, and had not seen the light of the sun or moon for seven days, but was guided by a walking fire, till he came to a castle, before which lay the giant whom St. Anthony slew, his flesh was rent and torn by wild foxes, crows, and such like.
To counter this the French introduced walking fire. The infantry used man-carried automatic weapons to keep the defender pinned down with a continuous hail of bullets for those last dangerous yards.
Although difficult to learn and to perform, walking fire, when practiced in co-ordination with hand- and rifle grenadiers, was the essence of training for the assault.
That new film is being advertised way too much, but it's working – everyone is joining the hype train.

"Jest let him get the grip on you that he got on me, an he'll make the best among ye walk turkey,” Bud retorted sharply.
I have thought proper to premise thus much, lest the incredible tale I have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination, than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity.
The legislatures rap them for lower fares, the federal government makes them walk turkey, and they see a man with a gun behind every bunch of grass, whichever way they turn.
My real life angel is my very own velvet hippo named Angel, and she is magical.

God creates the human family, but the mother is the instrument of creation and the child of the tired mother will always be born tired, and there is nothing so pitiful as the child born tired.
Instead, when speaking the truth, rather than getting kicked out of town or worse, getting strung up with a rope in the South, here in Boston and the North, generally they got back at troublemakers by taking your token job, kicking up the rent, and for serious punishment, they'd agree with you and the ideas you were mouthing then as quickly as possible help you get back to the South so they could see how long you'd last.
Are you one of that vast army which contends that they are "born tired"? If so, you are not a normal, healthy individual.
In truth, these little men were so far out of the reach of their masters, that they considered themselves as little less than immortal, and often kicked up a dust for the sole purpose of showing their authority.
New South Wales is quite literally regarded as a place where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest; that is, a paradise for uncles who have turned dishonest and for nephews who are born tired.
"...This habit of uselessly wasting time, is the whole difficulty; and it is vastly important to you, and still more so to your children that you should break this habit.” When Johnston, who was “born tired,” proposed to leave Illinois for Missouri, Lincoln scolded him in language that could well have applied to his peripatetic father: "such a notion is utterly foolish. What can you do in Missouri, better than here [in Illinois]?...

Some horses and ponies have "cold backs" or are "cinchy."
You have to kick up some money to the boss.
The question of whether biting, kicking, rearing, bucking and napping are vices is moot - still more so those horses with headshaking syndrome or cold backs - none of which, the author believes, can truly be described as vices.
Note: in some cases the pain may precede the development of overt lesions and the horse may be presented for a cold back ' or saddle resentment.
You could tell where he had been by the cloud of dust he had kicked up.
I had learned by then to hog it out with most cold back horses but knew little of real breaking.

RN: You think you should not have gone?, TN: Yeah, I think it was a bad one to do. It was a good idea, but we shouldn't have gone to the University of Maryland … It was the motliest crew you've ever seen., RN: Well, that's my view about going to the universities. Well, I hope it didn't bother you too much., TN: No, it didn't. It was just—I know, I was just embarrassed because the Chinese issued a complaint., RN: A complaint about what?, TN: Oh, you know, that they were being rude to the chairman—they were insulting Chairman Mao. There was nothing we could do! It's a free country!
I might say the young people in the back that had the banner which I couldn't read—it was already torn down when I saw it—you know, this is a free country. And I'm President, and I think it's very good—even when people express themselves that way—I'm not embarrassed by it. I think the reaction of all of you, because you were disturbed, did its job. There's no need for me to embarrass them. So, I think it's a proper place in our country for people to raise a banner or to ask the President a difficult question or to shout out a criticism., I don't have any problem with that. It's a free country. I want to keep it that way.
Curwen had inherited a printing business in Plaistow, east London. In 1915 the government appealed for scrap metal to help the war effort. Curwen gazed at the 'clever, fussy, pretentious Victorian typefaces spread about his composing room floor' and felt a wave of revulsion. He sent away more than 200 founts of type, retaining just one plain one, Caslon Old Face.

We will ring in the New Year at a ski resort.
[Adolf] Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him all Europe may be free, and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands; but if we fail then the whole world, including the United States, and all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister, and perhaps more prolonged, by the lights of a perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves that if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years men will still say, "This was their finest hour."
The Facebook page ‘Vets for Trump’ was hijacked by a North Macedonian businessman.
All the world was only the two Copleigh girls, Saumarez and I, ringed in with the lightning and the dark; and the guidance of this misguided world seemed to lie in my hands.

He was singing what he had been humming earlier that morning, first quietly, then as loud as he could: If you ride on the short bus clap your hands If you ride on the cheese bus, clap your hands.
So anyway, William Esham and I would be in school, but we were not in the same clasroom, but we rode the same bus home, so when it was time to get on the cheese bus (in those days we were not assigned seats, but nowadays, you are), I would get on the bus but I would never talk to anybody because I didn't know anybody at that time.
The curry powders of India are articles of considerable commercial traffic; 32,550 cwt. of curry stuff was imported into Ceylon, chiefly from India, in 1851.
The mean character density for the survey was 4060 characters per page. No recommendations on character density were found in the literature.
The printed destination line must have a minimum character height of 0.135 inch and a maximum character density of approximately 17 characters per inch.
In RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) mode, each 8-bit byte in a message contains two 4-bit hexadecimal characters. The main advantage of this mode is that its greater character density allows better data throughput than ASCII for the same baud rate.
With regards to this strand of research, Hayes (1987) finds that character recognition is independent of character density, whereas Chin (1973), whose data were collected from a different level of learning Chinese, reports the opposite.
Everything here is cash on the line. You can pay in advance for your room if you like, or you can pay every morning to keep the room that night.
Cash on the line had to be paid for them cattle.

Is there a way, other then creating my own command button, that I can get the dot dot dot button next to a field on my form in Access 2000.
Many of us are, after all, writers manqué: we too were going to be men of letters once — novelists, columnists, editors — men whose words would change the world, men whose words would even mean cash on the line.
“It is not good to change horses in mid-stream”, is what the famous American President Abraham Lincoln said.
[the words dot dot dot are in the title] How do I make a recordset field which may be cut short like on a search engine so it only displays a certain ammount of characters and then ends ...?
The excuse given by his Democrat Party was that the war was going on, and it was not wise to “change horses in mid-stream,” as the popular phrase was used during the months of electioneering before the votes were cast.
Let me read this part of the note for the court reporter: "Either meet my demands or dot dot dot.".
When I caught up to the swirling cherry top lights, I stopped to rest and to check out what was happening.

Interestingly, while you can open the doors from the outside push button, you can't close them from the outside. No big deal - merely an observation. There is a push button inside to close them.
Just before 1300, a train driver reported fast-flowing water near Pontrilas. Flash flooding removed ballast, leaving sections of track suspended in the air.
Flooding occurs in areas where the ground is unable to absorb all of the water, according to forecasters, who explained that flash flooding can also be caused by mudslides or breaks in dams or levees.

Mudchester Rovers conceded two goals early doors and never got back into the game.
And in this white belt borderland between the black belt South and the free labor North, few whites lamented that the slave drain continued to thin blacks out of their area and to thicken the institution in the most southern South, repeating the turtle-slow erosion of slavery in the most southern North between 1776 and 1830
"White prostitutes and gamblers and vicious resorts” come into the “Black Belt,” explained a black minister in Chicago, because “it is black; they operate with more safety than they do in the white belt."
The party was very dull, so I made an early doors exit.

Prolog has been used for many purposes, but its inventor, Alain Colmerauer, was interested in computational linguistics, and this remains a classic application for the language. Moreover, Prolog offers a number of tools which make life easier for computational linguists, and we are now going to start learning about one of the most useful of these: definite clause grammars, or DCGs as they are usually called.
When Tomorrow Comes was probably some sort of weepy love story which always got him laughing like a drain, often leading to his physical removal from the one and nines.
Essentially, our point is that while Britain's railways are seen as among the safest in the world, that situation is now seriously under threat by a combination of a rise in the number of near misses that are occurring as well as an increase in incidents arising from line blockages. In both these areas, the safety of track workers is put at risk.
We had to intercept, load, and run the shipment to our smaller, faster T-Crafts and well boats waiting near the shore to take it to a stash house. A typical job for us.
Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty sets out how an EU country might voluntarily leave the union. The wording is vague, almost as if the drafters thought it unlikely it would ever come into play.
The Scottish cross-bench peer who wrote Article 50 - the procedure by which the UK would leave the EU - believed it was "not irrevocable". In a BBC interview, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard said the UK could choose to stay in the EU even after exit negotiations had begun.
If the Liberal Democrats were to secure a majority in December, they would revoke Article 50, cancelling Brexit.
Theresa May has told MPs the UK could withhold payment of its £39bn Brexit "divorce bill" if a deal is not reached with Brussels.

The whale fishers can easily distinguish at a distance the cachalots from the whales, by the manner in which the former spout up the brine through their spiracles.
In such cases, and generally in any case, where the infliction of injury is not connected with a contravention of the present law, or with some other legal proceeding, whether intentional or the result of negligence, the whale fisher is liable only for any direct loss which may be caused by the pursuit itself, or incurred by fishermen or others in the way of necessary sacrifices made in order to avoid collision to any boat, vessel, cargo or tackle, even though the fish had not yet been taken out of the water.
In the throes of death it would pull the whale fisher at great speed.
Hubbuboo! by my soul, it is all true that I tell ye, I stood it myself, till the heart in my belly Flew up to my mouth, by the soul of Moll Kelly! And the thing sav'd my life was the drop of a dram.

Bravo! bravo! och! by the powers of Moll Kellys great big kettle, but we must be after having a toast now, so be after giving us a dacent one, Mr. Taffy.
In fact, Paddy has oaths rising gradually from the lying ludicrous to the superstitious solemn, each of which finely illustrates the nature of the subject to which it is applied. When he swears "By the contints o' Moll Kellys Primer," or "By the piper that played afore Moses," you are, perhaps, as strongly inclined to believe him as when he draws upon a more serious oath; that is, you almost regret the thing is not the gospel that Paddy asserts it to be.
Well, be the power of Moll Kelly, what do you think? I — I — I awoke! — for it was sleeping I was, all the time, and found myself partly covered by the coming-in tide!

[…] Everything we have is both of ours.
It also helped that the festival's main venue was the 250-seat Enzian Theater, an endearing hybrid of cinema, draft house and cappuccino art venue that makes sipping a beer while watching the story of a folksinging lesbian Tupperware lady (Lisa Udelson's Lifetime Guarantee: Phranc's Adventures in Plastic) seem perfectly natural.
Remember when there used to be a movie theater there. A draft house. The place that would sell you beer when you were only fifteen years old.
These alterations included a bevelled nose, modifications to the footsteps, grab irons, and lower cowls around the fans in the roof, to overcome height restrictions on some Southern Pacific lines in the east.
Following Theresa May’s departure, Tory party candidates running for prime minister appeared to agree that an investigation into the problem was needed, only to backtrack and give the nod instead to an investigation into all types of “prejudice and discrimination, including antisemitism.”

In such families incest serves to protect its members against separation anxiety (Eist and Mandel 1968; Gutheil and Avery 1977; Woodbury and Schwartz 1971). Their motto would probably be "The family that sleeps together keeps together."
Family Theatre's maxim "The family that prays together stays together," could apply to Falcon Crest if "prays" were changed to "preys." “The family that sleeps together keeps together” is another possibility. At least the intermarrying is not as bizarre as it is in Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelungs, in which Siegmund commits both incest and adultery with his married sister, Sieglinde, and their son Siegfried takes his aunt Brünhilde as his wife.
Also the first-named component has to be in excess of a given percentage (e.g. in the UK so-called French coffee has to contain at least 51% roasted coffee, the remainder being roasted chicory).
We can, of course, simply drift into the future, in which case where we end up will be the result of inertia buffeted by ad hocery and circumstance.
Everything was very simple—typically French coffee, served in a bowl and strongly flavored with chicory, along with a piece of bread—yet I was received as an old friend.
Emile has a taste for chicory-infused French coffees, a taste Alex doesn't share.
Just as overpopulation results in large segments of commoner population becoming immiserated, elite overproduction similarly results in large segments of elites becoming impoverished (not in absolute terms, as with common populace, but relatively to the standards of consumption needed to maintain the elite status).
There was even one man in the dining room sitting up at the table with his eating irons at the ready, tapping impatiently on the table, all the while gazing vacantly intot he middle distance, whistling a sad little ditty slightly out of key.

“We know about the favours you asked of her and now she is dead. We are working with the police” “Mutton shunters! Gah!” he spat once again and, as if disgusted by the words themselves, threw the cigar away.
In eighteenth-century London there were pubs known as mollie houses where men dressed as women.

The infection does not spread from one to another among the troops, and barcoo rot affects men living in solitude.
"Your Ladyship," Manfred said, taking the Baroness by the hand, bowed and kissed her fingers with a flourish I can only describe as both theatrical and of the feminine manner, a touch I found both surprising and distasteful, for the Baroness had not inform me Lord Manfred was a habitué of the Mollie House.
Colonel CJ Martin gives some observations on " barcoo rot." This is a very loosely applied term. The original "barcoo rot," as experienced by the older bushmen, was scurvy pure and simple.
Molly Houses — places where homosexual men gather— may have been around as early as 1700: this is where the historian Rictor Norton in fact locates the origins of a gay subculture in England (Norton 1992).
[I]n a Bow Street Runners raid on a Molly House called the White Swan, twenty-seven men were arrested for sodomy and attempted sodomy.
Add Barcoo rot to the torment and it was little wonder some boys came down with fever. Barcoo rot is a dreaded infection in the Barcoo and Thomson watersheds and it spreads voraciously in the humid summer months.
The regular Knothole section was in the right field pavilion, but sometimes the left field pavilion was open as well. The two sections would compete to see which one could root the loudest. After 1938 the Knotholers sat in the upper deck of the pavilions and stomped their feet on the metal floor until the noise reached a deafening crescendo. The teams played more and more night games after World War II, and as a result, Knothole days became fewer and fewer.
… mission in the north end zone, affectionately called The Knothole Section (TKS). Elementary and junior and senior high school students by the thousands filled the cheap seats and not only for the game. It was a social happening, because sanctioned gathering spots for kids were scarce.
This collector explained how as a young boy he dove for the balls when thrown into the stands at the knothole section.
A Molly house might adjoin a tavern or private house, often with guarded rooms, and provided an environment in which gay men could meet for drinking and entertainment, and engage in sexual acts, behind closed doors.
There were public houses in the vicinity where 'posture dancers' performed an eighteenth-century version of striptease; there were houses of pleasure which specialised in flagellation, and there were Mollie houses which were frequented by homosexuals.
There were also Mollie houses and clubs for homosexuals, among them the Bull and Butcher, the Spiller's Head, the Fountain, the Sun and the Bull's Head.

Martyrs are desperate to demonstrate their self-flagellatory capabilities in the hope that someone out there actually cares. If they think their peers or bosses really do, then they are seriously deluding themselves; I'm afraid the Martyr will be exploited until the pips squeak.
I’m no fan of the Labour leader, but if you take a look at the supposedly Marxist plans he and John McDonnell have put forward, they’re not exactly planning to tax the rich until the pips squeak.

I knew I needed to get my artwork out in front of the public since, for the first time in my life, I was really hungry. Hunger pain kind of hungry.
Donovan's observations show that the early onset of acute hunger pain subsides after approximately twenty-four hours. He quotes one of his cases as telling him that feelings of acute hunger were followed by symptoms that included “a feeling of weakness and sinking and an insatiable thirst for cold water."

The tributary state is the opposite of the garrison state. A garrison state retains its sovereign independence from foreign control or intimidation by jettisoning liberty. By contrast, a tributary state retains the liberties of its citizens by sacrificing sovereign independence.... The tributary state is familiar from history. Many weak countries have averted attack or conquest by bargaining with aggressors. In return for being allowed to preserve its internal autonomy and the way of life of its people, the tributary state may agree to defer to the aggressor in its foreign policy. Finland, during the Cold War, was a tributary state in this sense.
We're looking for ideas to pep up the new ad campaign.
In 1384 Bulgaria became a tributary state, and in 1391 was, after the battle of Nicopolis, definitely incorporated as a province of the Turkish Empire. Repeated efforts have been made for independence, the last in 1841.

In the course of being update the literary languages have experienced radical changes. An abundance of Russian terminology has been introduced in dictionaries; grammars have been prescribing the use of concurrent forms of the native and Russian languages as a norm.

For instance, after Steed says she and a Russian spy will be working “cheek to jowl,” Mrs. Peel, with a twinkle in her eye, responds that “his cheek will come nowhere near my jowl.”
The Russians used the “cheek to jowl” tactic, closing to less than 50 meters of the Wehrmacht's front line, too close for the Germans to call in artillery or Stuka support. It forced close quarters combat that the Russians had trained to conduct and the Germans had not.

We were compelled to go by carriage, as the railroads had been destroyed, the fat-pine cross-ties burned to heat the rails and the red-hot rails wrapped around the trees growing near the track. We used to call these iron rails "Sherman's neckties," and the solemn-looking chimneys standing guard over the former sites of once happy homes were called by the natives "Sherman's monuments."]

The Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association, which opened Washington’s home as a national shrine in 1860, reacted ambivalently toward later proposals for electric streetcar service between Washington and Mount Vernon.

There just wasn’t any place on the farm for four more Heinz 57 dogs running around.

Many of the changes which have taken place in the newspaper field within the last fifty years have been in the direction of specialization. At the turn of the century, for example, a reporter got his stories, wrote them, and sometimes even made up his own headlines. Legmen and rewrite men were practically unknown.

Such a lethal crossfire is the lot of a dying political breed: the deficit hawk, who obsesses on an accounting number as the lodestar of economic well-being.

'An Egyptian darkness,' Demyan Lukich remarked, lifting the blind a little.
Travelling porters do not ride in the trains at off-peak times, when guards supervise boarding and alighting and give the right-away signal if no station staff is available, for if only there is only one station porter on duty he may be on the opposite platform.

Moreover, industrial capitalism not only produced a new form of economic integration between metropolitan and colonial societies, it also stimulated the emergence of what is known as social imperialism—that is, the projection overseas of the social discontents and dislocations engendered by industrialization at home.

World War II and its influx of American servicemen into Auckland provided the impetus for MacKenzie's dual career. The frock shop was finally shut in 1957, as the knock shop continued to thrive.

Later, following the general tendency towards a more 'painterly' taste, came the soft Ohrmuschel or auricular style of about 1620 and after, characterized by forms like parts of conch shells or the gristle of an ear.
The choice and treatment of the motifs which form the inner ornamental border - rams' heads and drapery - suggest a Northern goldsmith familiar with the early auricular style.
The auricular style appears to have come to Northern Europe via the engravings of Hendrick Goltzius, who may have seen it in Tuscany during his visit to Italy in 1591.

The auricular or lobate style, known in Holland as Kwabornament and in Germany as Knorpelwerk, appears to be the only ornamental style which was developed mainly by silversmiths and found its fullest and most notable expression in silver.
The two-handled cup and cover by the Hound Sejant maker at Wadham College, Oxford, to which he compared it, shows a similar tentative application of the lobate style to an essentially English form.
No longer is plausible deniability acceptable, either for boards or for management. Corporate and nonprofit boards alike are expected to know of problems that are brewing deep within their organizations.

for the Chinese virus to find its way into the ducks of the Red River delta or Mekong Delta or the central plains of Thailand, it helps a lot if, in between those places, you have lots of hugely susceptible chickens.
Stocks mostly recover on hope for handling of Chinese virus.
There were supposed to be armies. Grand armies of contact tracers crisscrossing every county in the country on the hunt for the Chinese virus.
Taking a page from Court TV, some enterprising soul will start Death TV. If there are stations devoted to food, sex and weather, why not one to the way of all flesh?
First it was the Chinese virus, then we had the murder hornets, then we had to close the embassy in Houston because of espionage … Now we’ve got all these mystery seeds coming in in the mail.

The first stranger handed his neighbor the family mug—a huge vessel of brown ware, having its upper edge worn away like a threshold by the rub of whole generations of thirsty lips that had gone the way of all flesh.
Ageism has been blamed for islands of death in nursing homes (Mueller, 2020), and for a spike in intergenerational animosity, as captured in internet epithets such as “grandma/grandpa killer,” “boomer remover,” and “boomer doomer” (pre-Covid-19; “coffin dodger”).

A melody and the counter melody to it should sound well as a duet without accompaniment.
But when the melody and counter melody actually do cross (as in Ex. 37), care should be taken to avoid giving the ear the impression that such crossing has not taken place.
Karli shook himself, drove home the last nail with a flat stone, straightened up.
She had dropped sideways in Gerty's big arm-chair, her head buried where lately Selden's had leaned, in a beauty of abandonment that drove home to Gerty's aching senses the inevitableness of her own defeat.
Money is endogenous and not exogenous money (represented by the usual textbook assumption of helicopter money).
A more fundamental defect in the argument that helicopter money will always resuscitate the economy is that it focuses exclusively on the logic of buyers while totally ignoring the logic of sellers.
Anything, she thought, was better than bickering or the strange silence which drove home to her the distance between them.
Of horse players and the ragged army of grifters, touts and downright swindlers who attach themselves to the noble sport of kings there is no end of stories. Get a few of the chalk eaters and long shot hounds together during a lull in the day's occupation—picking the next day's card of winners—and the tales begin to come, thick and fast.
The urgent need for vaccines was driven home by the expected postponement on Monday of Britain’s plan to reopen, caused by the spread of a variant known as Delta among the unvaccinated population.
Yet, the chalk players have such confidence in Secretariat that a $2 bet will likely fetch no more than $2.10 or $2.20 if he wins at Belmont.
One of the last customs that passed from the decks of the modern navy was the “shooting of Charlie Noble.” The chimney or galley-stack of the ship's kitchen was dignified by the name of Charlie Noble, and when the galley-stack became clogged with soot the ship's cook fired a blank cartridge up it, loosening the soot.
Alternate history is[…]a mournful exercise; in it, the world we know has been erased, and usually not for the better. Sometimes the main character realizes this, but most often the reader alone is left to fathom the loss.
On the third and fourth shelves are the different races of domestic fowls, and near them several wild species from India and the Moluccas. It cannot yet be decided from which of them our common yard fowls have sprung.
Our mother kept a dozen chickens, two turkeys, a few ducks and a guinea fowl. They were our ‘yard fowls’. She had caused our father to build coops of wood, board and wire-netting for them. We kept the yard fowls cooped up during the planting season each year so they wouldn’t pick the leaves off the young corn.
[D]ozens of persons were awaiting the boat in order to load huge hands of ‘green fig’, plantains and mafoubay, baskets of blue dasheen, ‘renter’ yam, yellow yam, cassava and sweet potatoes, parcels of finely ground farine, bags of wet sugar, cages of ‘yard fowl’, tightly tethered hogs, sheep and goats which would be taken to Trinidad to be bought by the Marketing Board and private traders that would be waiting at the docks in Port-of-Spain.
On their first flight, the pilots also made sure about the "droop snoot".
his Majesty likewise foreseeing of what mischievous consequence it would be to all his loving subjects if the States General, upon the execution of the said Letters of Reprisal (contrary to the meaning of the said Treaties, and after the annulling of them by the same), should grant Letters of Countermarque against the said subjects and their goods, to the hindering of commerce and the ruin and damage of many particular men, although unconcerned in the case of such Reprisal :
The old and the present enumeration in English policies is, "perils of the seas, men of war, fire, enemes, pirates, rovers, thieves, jettisons, letters of mart and countermart, surprisals, takings at sea, arrests, restraints and detainments of all kings, princes, and people, of what nation, condition or quality soever, barratry of the master and mariners, and all other perils."
After that came off there was just my undershirt, stained with sweat. he smiled at it for a while and then said as he heaved himself out of the chair, "There. You should have worn that all day, just that. That has real taste. The rest of your outfit was just gilding that lily of a sweat shirt."
Letters of countermart were similar commissions by which reprisals on an enemy's merchant shipping were given state sanction.
Perhaps the German Emperor is the only man who really believes in the “Yellow Peril,” and what is this “Yellow Peril”?, The thought that the Japanese will get control of 500,000,000 Chinamen, arm them, and kill off the white men is so absurd that a child would laugh at it.
I hope to see the day that finding virus vaccines is routine and quick.
Will we ever again see the day of full churches?
I cannot, after a survey necessarily crammed with conjecture, conceive that the Yellow Peril will devastate Europe, or endanger the East Indies, though it may change their populations.
As long as the United States remains committed to aggressive capitalism domestically and aggressive militarism internationally, Asians and Asian Americans will continue to be scapegoats who embody threat and aspiration, an inhuman “yellow peril” and a superhuman model minority.
Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, the medical arm of the National Academy of Sciences, was more pessimistic. “We’re completely unprepared,” Dr. Fineberg said, adding that if an epidemic struck in the next year, the quarantine-based strategy called social distancing “is likely to be all we’re going to have as a strategy.”
A spokesman confirmed that work would continue on projects such as the construction of a grade-separated junction at Werrington … where compliance with government advice and "social distancing can be guaranteed".
It was such a journey as I had taken once before, early in our pursuit of the genius of the Yellow Peril; but this was infinitely more terrible; for now we were utterly in Fu-Manchu’s power.
A huge crowd—visibly not observing social distancing—turned up Friday at the birthday community pantry organized by actress Angel Locsin in Quezon City.

Man caves are better known on the mainland, where space isn't a problem.
The point of departure was Minnegara, the modern Ahmedpur on the Indus; thence it followed the great road still frequented through Cabulistan into Bactria. Here three roads diverged. One led across the Belurtag mountains to Central Asia, East Turkistan, the desert of Gobi, and Thibet, and was the avenue of trade with the seres inhabiting this region.
Many unfortunate suckers, finding themselves losers, even in an honest game, became obstreperous, and the services of the bouncer, or even of a resident gunhand, might be required to pacify them, after which the complainant would be hauled to the crowbar hotel to recover enough of his equanimity to appear peacefully before a justice of the peace.
The general boundaries of East Turkistan are the Altai range on the northeast, Mongolia on the east, the Kansu corridor or the Su-lo-ho basin on the southeast, the K'un-lun system on the south, the Sarygol and Muztay-ata on the west, the main range of the T'ien-shan system on the north to the approximate longitude of Aqsu (80 deg. E), then generally northeast to the Altai system which the boundary joins in the vicinity of the Khrebët Nalinsk and Khrebët Sailjuginsk.

The Uyghur Human Rights Project is deeply concerned by alarming new evidence that local residents are starving across the Uyghur homeland. Since mid-February, Uyghur-language social media has lit up with disturbing videos, photos, and other information providing evidence that a month-long coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown is leaving many East Turkistan residents hungry.
If Vick gets 18 months in the crowbar hotel, as speculated, that essentially means two seasons away from the NFL.
And now they were playing Fuzzy Duck. Except, it never got far around the circle as everyone was sufficiently drunk and tongue tied.

Some day, I feel like the old timer who once said, "Jiminy Crickets, hain't life changed since I was a boy?"
"Jiminy Crickets, what's all the racket about," he hollered.
A piece of my dog's plastic chew toy broke off and he swallowed it, requiring surgery to remove it. The procedure was very expensive, but fortunately I had pet insurance.

"They have this term in Hollywood, movie jail. When a director does this horrible movie that fails, he's in movie jail, where they're not letting him make another movie again."
Back at the farm, David bundled up in his new outdoor outfit, added a Davy Crockett hat (with tail) and a .410 shotgun, joined his genial grandfather in the fields for a brief try at rabbit hunting.
"Movie jail is real. He's been there. He was excommunicated at Fox for a decade after turning down Speed 2 to go play Hamlet onstage in fucking Winnipeg."
The words were scarcely out of her mouth, when they were greeted with a roar of Homeric laughter that literally shook the room, and this time not at the expense of the innocent speaker.
Primarily the work of Hildebert Wagner at the Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology, Munich, and Klaus Keplinger at Innsbruck University, studies revealed that cat's claw was antiviral in the feline crown virus, the lamb Maed visna virus, human herpesvirus, and effective against neurobronchitis and allergies.
At the same time, a combination of α-interferon and ribavirin has been turned out to be efficient at the treatment of the widely distributed viral hepatitis C; this combination could also be promising for the therapy of the recent outbreak of the RNA-viral infection of atypical pneumonia induced by a crown virus.
But the Professor! He ought to have exploded in a burst of Homeric laughter, or else to have shaken his head at her and warned her where little girls go to who do this sort of thing.
[They] feel by turns the bitter change.
As a group of policemen went past him, one of them rounded on him, grabbing him by the arm.
Perhaps, too, the opinion that the relics of the holy dead were distinguished by a peculiar fragrance may have arisen from embalmed bodies: at first, it might honestly have obtained among the Clergy; but when they saw how willingly it was received by the people, whenever a new mine of relics was opened, care was taken that the odour of sanctity should not be wanting.
During the Middle Ages a sweet smell came to be expected of holy corpses, " and if the corpse of a servant of God did not emit 'the odour of sanctity,' the veneration might stop as quickly as it had begun.
These 'immortals' were either resurrected or their bodies regrew, or the corpse did not go cold and emitted a 'pleasant' odour of sanctity.
She told me straight up that she did not want to go.
The Jesuits were flourishing in general favour at this time; Anchieta 's memory was still fresh in Brazil, and Almeida was then living in the odour of sanctity.
Gimme a margarita, straight up.
William, though indolent, was not altogether unsuitable for the post, and he died in an odour of sanctity (he was canonized by Pope Honorius III in 1226).
... a gilt coif above her marble face. On the entablature, among the heraldic scutcheons, may be read in lapidary Latin how Sabina, Comitessa de Roodhurst, died in the odour of sanctity in the year after her lord, hasting to rejoin him in Heaven.
... Churches, easily attained to Saintſhip, which those of lower Rank, tho' perhaps much better and holier Persons, not having wherewithal to build them, could not do, but lived and died, without leaving the least Odour of Sanctity behind them.
The twenty-six cartloads of relics which were brought here when the building was dedicated to Sta Maria ad Martyres, have failed to give it the odour of sanctity.
It has neither the odour of sanctity, nor the flavour of philosophy. And I greatly fear that most of the ministers who come to do the duty, at so many dollars a-head, do it rather like students reciting a theme as part of their task-work, than as gospel [ … ]
He dismissed the idea on sight.
The carotids were in their natural state; the arteria innominata and the subclavian were twice their natural diameter: their smaller branches were proportionally dilated and bent zigzag.
On the basis that if you cannot beat them, join them, some, like Private 'Umbriago' Hillier, who was later to prove his guts and character, emulated all the traits of the seasoned veteran. He earned the reputation of being 'a canteen cowboy' and a 'tailboard Romeo', always chatting up the girls at the NAAFI canteen and ogling and whistling at girls from the back of the Company transport.
For one thing, he wanted to see if anyone was following Ricketts. The Cockney had been thrown out of SAS because he was a loner and a canteen cowboy.
This, to be sure, was an error in interpretation, but it made it possible to associate with the Eleusinian mysteries also a notion familiar from other contexts, the notion of mystical rebirth as a child of the godhead.
Their origins are in the ancient Greek cult, in particular the most famous one, the Eleusinian mysteries.
The priest is saying the wedding vows and the bridegroom and the bride repeat it one after another. Then finally he says “I pronounce you man and wife, you may kiss the bride” and the newly wed couple kiss; all the guests in the church clap.
It is traditional in India for newly wed brides to wear special wedding clothes and jewellery for a certain period after marriage.
Was early Shōwa Japan (1926-1945) thus fascist? As we saw at the start of this article, this question has been a key issue for research. We can’t provide any clear and final answer, or at least not a simple one.
Capitalism has always had these two faces—on the one hand, the face of a unique engine of prosperity and innovation, on the other the face of casino capitalism, of speculation and crash.
Biochemical effects following X irradiation were investigated in an effort to detect early signs which are indicative of injury or are of prognostic value.
Finally, the data mentioned so far have said very little about the possibility of using heat and X irradiation as independent modalities.

Those who rattle sabres, I think history has shown, have gained in the long run only hatred or ridicule, or both.
Hill climbing requires considerable skill.
For its part, the Russian Interior Ministry “used its contacts with its Ukrainian counterparts to identify potential agents and sources,” while the task for the Russian military was “to rattle sabres loudly on the border” for maximum effect.
The head of the Montenegrin Communists, Momir Bulatovic, did not miss the opportunity to sabre rattle, even though only with words.
Those in the United States who want to sabre rattle at China and who think that this is a terrible threat are sadly mistaken.
The nineteenth century waas par excellence one of naval scares, not necessarily boosted by diplomatic crisis as in the period of intermittent war, when it had been Britain's turn to rattle the sabre, impressment serving as a successful diplomatic weapon in 1770 (the Falklands), 1787 (Holland) and 1790 (Nootka Sound).
As he told the kaiser's son, the crown prince, 'In any war which is unleashed without compelling reason, not only the Hohenzollern crown but the future of Germany is at stake. ... to rattle the sabre at any diplomatic entanglement without having honor, security, or the future of Germany endangered is not only bold beyond reason, but criminal.'
Three counts of breaking and entering, four counts of assault, seven misdemeanors for carrying illegal substances, and a partridge in a pear tree,” Paul finished with a smirk, handing the rap sheet to Mason.
And when it comes to a gunboat, you've got some very good people here. It's not up to you to declare war on Afghanistan of course but get permission to rattle a sabre!
Every few days some unfortunate was buried on Boot Hill, a victim of his own inexpertness with the six-shooter.
Specular Stones were a shining kind of Substance, and (according to Basil ) transparent like the Air.
One use of mica or of selenite that especially merits notice is mentioned by Pliny, when, speaking of the material of which bee-hives should be formed, he says many had made them of the specular stone, that they might see the bees at work within.
Where have all the TV Westerns gone? A genre once adored by viewers lies dead, but not forgotten, in television's Boot Hill.

The main suspect refused to answer any questions, but the police got chapter and verse from his accomplice.
They were furnished with wooden sashes in which were placed transparent or specular stones. These were of various kinds:
The glass (ϋαλοϛ), in coffins of which Herodotus (iii., 24) says the Ethiopians called μακροϐίοι inclosed their dead, which was dug among them in great abundance and easily worked, was, of course, one or other of these specular stones.
[T]he old demands of manhood suffrage and annual parliaments were made, but the principal cry was for ‘Bread! Bread!’
Their present policy of sterilizing monetary inflows is creating imbalances which suggests, sooner rather than later, they're going to have to, for stability purposes, move their currency.
The response rate is probably higher when treatment is applied sooner rather than later after diagnosis and to children with VSAA rather than AA.

They return from camp with new boots, shirt, stockings and money; part of which is spent in excess on their first night's return after training and part goes to purchase a pair of “peaky blinder” trousers.
The rise of gaming has its own place in the story of digital culture, but Cerf warns that important political and historical documents will also be lost to bit rot.
As Arthur Matthison recalled (1937:63), the peaky blinder wore: Bell-bottomed trousers secured by a buckle belt, hob-nailed boots, a jacket of sorts, a gaudy scarf and a billy-cock hat with a long elongated brim.
It beggars belief to suppose that corporate policies can always pursue the best interests of a company.
You could practically hear the rusty wheels whirring round beneath his black peaky blinder.

“I like to split a gut laughing the first time I saw a bride in a miniskirt,” Mrs. Fenniman cackled.
By systematic organization and effort we have been endeavoring to combat Spanish Influenza in Luzerne County, with its population of 350,000 souls.
Disgustingly vulgar trash to her; trash that her half-brother and others in hilarious laughter split a gut over.
Increasingly, low-lying coastal cities in the United States are experiencing what’s known as sunny-day flooding, when all it takes is a high tide to send water gushing into the streets.
In the wake of the devastation of the Spanish flu, the world came together to develop unprecedented scientific collaborations to take on future pandemics. In 1947, the WHO Interim Committee of the United Nations established a Global Influenza Programme to track the changes in the virus.
Nicholson's reputation with the ladies apparently put the cabosh on his affair with Anspach.

If the halyards are not single, the yard must be sent down by a yard rope, like the topgallant yard. In some vessels, instead of making the sheets and clewlines fast to the jack, over-hand knots are taken in their ends, and they are let go.
When "high enough" for rigging, the grummet which confines the yard rope to the yard is taken off the upper yard-arm, and the yard-arms rigged (Fig. 257).

Dany has never had a full vision for what happens once she obtains the Iron Throne, but that’s what her advisors, including Tyrion and Varys, are for. And the show has never exactly spelled out Jon’s platform beyond “stay alive,” so he’d also require a small council.
Made from mixing oil from laurel (bay) trees with olive oil and soda, Aleppo soap uses no chemicals or other additives.
The environment secretary’s campaign was blown off course at the weekend after revelations about cocaine use. But on the day the Tory leadership contest launched in earnest, Gove insisted he was still “in it to win it”.
Making sure Sin City still shines brighter than creation's dark
Around our block of residency was an open space, and beyond it were the military bazar on one side, with regimental barracks (little fortified squares) scattered over the plain on the others in the direction of the city. Amongst those to the northward, and at no great distance, is a neat building surrounded by tall poplars within the enclosing walls of its court-yard. It is one of the Atalik's harems, and is said to contain a hundred and twenty fair creatures from different parts of the country. There is another inside the fort and a third at Yangi Hissar. The total number of their inmates is variously estimated at from two hundred and fifty to four hundred women, amongst whom there are, it is said, representatives of almost every people from the cites of CHina on the east to the markets of Constantinople on the west, and from the steppes of Mongholia on the north to the valleys of the Himalaya on the south. The modern Napoleon of the Tatar steppes, as his admirers are pleased to style him on account of his successful usurpations, may be with equal propriety styled the Solomon of the age, for if he has not the proverbial wisdom of that ancient king, he at least emulates him in the number of his wives and concubines.
The food pyramid surprised me by showing that we should eat lots of cheese.
Brecht always believed that if you paid good money for anything, you should expect good service or a good product in return.

Examine the stain and spot clean it with an appropriate cleaner.
Under you drop, and you work yourself along until you come to the partition between the two rooms; there you'll find a secret chamber; it isn't big enough for more than one person at a time, but there's a cot in it and you can lay low.
As a university we have for the most part stayed away from organizations and efforts that we perceive as “fauxpen” or engaging in “open washing”.
Many cultural institutions making the move towards open practice struggle with the challenges of securing high-level 'buy-in' to support such initiatives; this case study also considers the institutional risks of open washing and neglecting staff development in this area.
As for the Turk , he played his old game of Brer Rabbit, laying low, until the three launches came nicely round the bend into a direct line of fire.
This is exacerbated by a general tendency to “open wash” existing products or generate new projects with questionable governance.

Our Frankie's part of the the X Generation is what they call it.
Since you are trying to lay low, your effort should take the form of a suggestion at the least or a modest proposal at the most.
Duffy argues the need to change course designs to incorporate Web 2.0 technologies because the habits, customs and codes of Millennium and X Generation students differ from those of previous generations.
I laid low until the boys and Chancey went off somewhere, then I snuck up the road and stopped at the gate.
The Pontiac Aztec is a now-classic example of a product that attempted to capture the X generation with a car customized to their every need.
I have included information, such as the adoption of electronic means of communication and the need to evangelize the members of the X generation, which I certainly had not foreseen when I last wrote.
Bennett believed that he would lay low for a few years before bringing out another team of terrorists.
We have always to interpret, to provide the meaning for what we see, and for that we can only draw upon human values, emotions and interpretations. When we gaze at animals we hold up a mirror to ourselves.
In the meantime, he would lay low—not make waves if he could help it. He was good at not attracting attention.
Let him hold up a mirror to himself and realize that he is the devil's numero uno servant.
Me and the boys are gonna go hang out for a bit.
Say, “The first step for changing a reputation is to lay low. This means you need to keep a low profile for a while and not draw attention to yourself. This will give your reputation a chance to die down before you try to make friends.
Jessie needed time to let things die down and decided to lay low.
Cognitive biases can be adaptive when they speed decision-making.
When the government realised that a new virus was circulating, Chinese officials didn’t advise hand washing, a better cough etiquette and disposing of tissues. They quarantined entire cities and shut down the economy. As one former secretary of state for health in England put it to me, our scientists suffered from a “cognitive bias” towards the milder threat of influenza.
Richie, I know you don't like people telling you what to do and all but I think you should lay low until we can figure this thing out.
Doom offered a good, two minute release, but my K/D ratio was terrible. I needed something new, with a bit more space in game to get my bearings before getting shot.
We layed low until after dark, then mounted without the bugle sound.

Side play is allowed on the middle driving axle and its motor has freedom to move sideways with the axle, but the motors on the two outer driving axles are resiliently held irrespective of movement of the axles, which have reduced side-play.

Your love for her is getting embarrassing. … She's gorgeous, she has buckets of charisma she couldn't hide if she tried, and she makes all the boys fall in love with her. That sounds like Manic Pixie Dreamgirl territory, my friend—which, news flash again, is a cliché.
The police raid uncovered a large quantity of child porn on the teacher's laptop.
The scenario of humanity going extinct in the next century is a disjunctive event. It could happen as a result of any of the existential risks we already know about—or some other cause which none of us foresaw.
In an industry that relies more than anything on the appearance of total control, total safety, these two crashes pose as close to an existential risk as you can get.
I believe TSLA faces existential risk based on what is happening in the world today, and that this recent scare and economic recession will only catalyze further share price decline.

But you must remember that we were boys together, and a fellow naturally confides in a chap he was boys together with. Anyway, be that as it may, he poured out his soul to me, and he hadn't been pouring long before I was able to see that he was cut to the quick. His blood pressure was high, his eye rolled in what they call a fine frenzy, and he was death-where-is-thy-sting-ing like nobody's business.
But the divinity of Jesus is as historically vexing as it is theologically crucial. Any assertion about this doctrine's theological centrality has a provocative, historical correlate: the early Jesus movement (first?) became Christianity when regular, public and sanctioned devotion was offered to Jesus alongside of, and as, the monos theos of Judaism.
Alfar's analysis cuts to the quick of the socioeconomic structures that underlie marriage, primogeniture, monarchy, and imperialism.

IP in IP is an unusual mechanism: not only does it use two network layers, it uses the same protocol on both.
“You know, there’s a new name,” Mrs. Clinton said in the March appearance. “It’s unexplained aerial phenomenon,” she said. “U.A.P. That’s the latest nomenclature.”
Although IP in IP incurs an overhead, as the size of the headers is doubled, it may allow you to create a connection between two hosts that would otherwise be blocked by a firewall.
The reason the term unexplained aerial phenomenon is being used, he said, is because although ‘UFO’ is better-known, it brings with it certain connotations – usually involving little green men.
While the Kecksburg UFO sighting has become a quaint part of local lore, more recent reports of unexplained aerial phenomena are getting serious attention from Congress, the U.S. military and longtime UFO watchers.

Such was the view held within the Great Church of the third and fourth centuries, from which all our existing forms of Christianity can trace their descent.
The settlers in Sapta Sindhu composed the Rig Veda, the first of the Vedas, the ancient sacred writings of the Hindu religion.
Although Chalcedon seemed to offer the possibility of their reconciliation with the Great Church, this hope was not fulfilled.
We must remember that the Byzantine rite is basically the rite of the Great Church, and in a cathedral the size of Hagia Sophia to have done all this in the church itself just before the transfer of gifts would have taken an enormous amount of time.

Many parents often feel exhausted by the constant arguing, back chat and debate they receive from their children. Once you tell a child off, he will talk back and debate the issue endlessly.

[ … ] the material in the interview indicated to me that he’s celebrating a Novus Ordo Mass in Latin.
I’ve heard many make the case that the Novus Ordo actually more closely resembles the Mass of the first 1000 years of Church history than the recent practice of the Tridentine (Latin) Masses. Surely Jesus didn’t speak Latin at the Last Supper. But many others point out that what has become of the Novus Ordo Mass was not what was originally intended either.
Why is your ass always so late?

There is still another method of night hunting by the salt lick. … When night approaches, the hunter finds a piece of phosphorescent wood or "fox fire," and places it on the ground, at a point which he has previously determined to be on a direct line of the aim of his gun. The "fox fire" is plainly seen from the tree, and as soon as it is darkened he knows that it is obscured by the deer, and he pulls the trigger and kills his game.
Curiously enough, there were fluorescent displays underground that could be enjoyed without benefit of an ultraviolet lamp. One of these was fox fire, the spectral glow given off by fungi on decaying timber. In the damp darkness of the mine, pine planks 3 inches thick could become feather light and crumbly in a year.

Major Strasser has been shot... round up the usual suspects.
The plantocracy argued that abolitionists' efforts were largely responsible for stirring the St. Dominguan slaves to revolt. The planters contended, furthermore, that the absence of a similar rebellion in Jamaica proved that [ … ]
And yet a quiet campaign is in the works to secure landmark protection for the 46-story limestone and glass tower. It is not being led by the usual suspects, like preservationists, community groups or politicians.
Although none of the actors in Murdock's play appears to be a known refugee, St. Dominguan actors had appeared regularly on Philadelphia stages during the decade, and thus, Murdock's refugee characters appeared in close proximity to [real refugees].
The St. Dominguan arrived in Patillas in 1826, where he bought a plantation in Río Chiquito.
It was - to be only a little bit unfair - all the usual suspects at the Paris demo. Trotskyite students chanting against the patriarchy; anarchists; grizzled veterans of '68; plenty of pensioners; theatre-workers. In other words the regular left-wing alphabetti-spaghetti.
In urging angry St. Dominguans to accept the decree, the merchants described a revolution whose logic was universal and irrefutable. The rights restored to whites had to be matched by those belonging to other “free beings,” they explained.
If you're already thinking ahead to next year's holidays you can double your break and get a whopping 52 days off using just 26 days of annual leave.
Once again it becomes apparent that the Christians, however devoted to the hebraica veritas, could not be so bold as the Jews; for their interpretations were always subject to censorship by the custodians of an infallible tradition that was partly independent of Scripture.
Jerome had gone to Palestine to study the Hebrew language at its source and produce a new translation of the Bible from a restored hebraica veritas.
The European Working Time Directive, brought into UK law in 1998, says workers should receive their 'normal' pay when they go on annual leave.
Guy returned to Salomon’s a week later. ‘It is audacious of me to ask you for a favor that will only waste your time, but I have come to think that to truly understand scripture, I must ascertain the Hebraica veritas from the original Hebrew.’
Recruitment firm Glassdoor has similarly alarming statistics: 23% of employees who took annual leave in 2018 regularly checked their emails, while 15% continued working throughout their holiday because of fear of falling behind and the consequences of not hitting their targets.
At this point the Old Latin versions are almost incoherent: we must follow Jerome's hebraica veritas instead.
Jerome began it, offering hebraica veritas, and Greek truth also, but in Latin.

Father Murray is concerned to restate the Gelasian dyarchy in democratic terms.
Between secularists and anticlericals who would subject the Church to the state or entirely separate the institutions, and fanatical medievalists and curialists who would, against all reasonable hope, cling to their own inaccurate versions of theocracy, the pope steered a middle course that recalled the Gelasian dyarchy.
But what their admirers call grit and critics deem shamelessness can overshadow another essential element of the Clinton school: a willingness to put on the hair shirt of humility to regain power.

Unlike Spain, Cable Street was a success and proved the turning point in the defeat of Fascism in Britain in that period.
How can one explain the hypocrisy, chop logic and outright lying now being mustered daily in defence of hunting with hounds?
Cable Street happened, and thousands of ordinary folk did actually stop a fascist march from taking place in an unprecedented manner: the East End was never the same again.
It takes a peculiar kind of chopped logic to see Mao Zedong, almost an archetypal chili pepper-loving Hunanese, as a northerner.

Since this systematic bias in scientific information and recognition practices fits the second half of Matthew 13:12 in the Bible, which refers to the under-recognition accorded to those who have little to start with, it is suggested that sociologists of science and knowledge can add to the 'Matthew Effect', made famous by Robert K. Merton in 1968, the "Matilda Effect", named for the American suffragist and feminist critic Matilda J. Gage of New York, who in the late nineteenth century both experienced and articulated this phenomenon.

Meanwhile the jack boot, as it is called, had become indispensable in the costume of cavalry soldiers and horsemen generally; and it was regularly adopted in England by William III and his followers. Strongly made, the jack boot extended in length above the knee, was wide at the top, had a very high heel, and around the ankle had a flat leather band, by which a powerful spur was attached.

The traction motors serve as generators when dynamic braking is used, the generated output being dissipated in fan-cooled resistance banks mounted in a removable roof section. The degree of dynamic braking is under the control of the driver.
On the long, continuous downgrades of East Africa dynamic braking is of special value; the traction motors are used as generators and their energy output dissipated in force-ventilated banks of resistors.

Rollover techniques, for example, once required JavaScript, but have been possible with CSS for many years now. The same thing is true of table-row zebra striping, which until recently could only be achieved by using additional markup on tr elements, or by using JavaScript to dynamically add this markup. [ … ] One of the most common ways of styling data tables, both in print and on the web, is to alternate the background colors of rows of data—a technique sometimes referred to as zebra striping. Typically, zebra stripes are implemented in HTML and CSS by applying a class such as odd or even to every other row in the HTML markup, then using a class selector to apply a background color to odd, even, or both classes of row.

At length, when matters were conſidered ſufficiently ripe, a council, compoſed of about forty conſtitutional or intruding biſhops, and as many prieſts of the ſame deſcription, was held at the church of Nôtre Dame, the body of which was filled with an immenſe crowd of ſpectators. [ … ] The Council then adjourned to deliberate in ſeparate diviſions at Saint Sulpice, but their decrees were promulgated at Nôtre Dame.
Here a crucial political decision was taken by unaminous vote: the armed revolt under preparation would not be one single blow aimed at drawing concessions from France, but an "unlimited revolution" à outrance to continue until full independence was achieved.
In the next church I visited, Nôtre Dame, which is better known than the cathedral, as containing the bodies and tombs of Charles the Bold and his daughter, Anne of Burgundy, there is no sculpture equal to this majestic figure; but in the sister branch of the fine arts—painting, Nôtre Dame possesses a chef d’œuvre from the pencil of Rubens, which is indeed admirable.
The Sainte-Chapelle was Gothic art carried to an ultimate extreme: the church transformed into light. Such churches were immensely costly, and the experiment was never repeated. Nor would it have been possible to build a great cathedral on the same model. Nôtre Dame, though largely designed by the same architects, suffered from its immense size, and not even the great rose windows on the transepts could flood it with light.
However, apart from Windham and Fitzwilliam (and also the King, whose views hardly counted any more), no one in Government had any relish left for an ideological war à outrance.
Nidarosdomen is a chatedral^([sic]) that whose construction was started some 800 or 900 years ago, and has a certain resemblance to the Nôtre Dame in Paris.

I used Euclid's Lemma in a slightly sly way in the second chapter, where I ran through the argument that √2 is irrational. I said there that if 2 is a factor of a² then a itself must be even. This follows from Euclid's Lemma upon taking p=2, the only even prime, and taking b=a. Indeed, using Euclid's Lemma it is not hard to generalize the argument showing √2 to be irrational to prove that √p is irrational for any prime p.

The contact geometry is in many ways an odd-dimensional counterpart of the symplectic geometry, a structure on certain even-dimensional manifolds. The concepts of contact geometry and symplectic geometry are both motivated by the mathematical formalism of classical mechanics, where one can consider either the even-dimensional phase space of a mechanical system or the constant-energy hypersurface, which, being of codimension 1, has odd dimension.
A contact manifold (M,𝜁) is a (2n+1)-dimensional manifold M equipped with a smooth maximally nonintegrable hyperplane field 𝜁⊂TM, i.e., locally, 𝜁= ker 𝛼, where 𝛼 is a 1-form which satisfies 𝛼∧(d𝛼)ⁿ ne 0. Since d𝛼 is a nondegenerate 2-form when restricted to 𝜁, contact geometry is customarily viewed as the odd-dimensional sibling of symplectic geometry. Although contact geometry in dimensions > 5 is still in an incipient state, contact structures in dimension 3 are much better understood, largely due to the fact that symplectic geometry in two dimensions is just the study of area.
Along the trajectories dissipated power is calculated and projected onto the surface grid by a method using geometrical data on the contact geometry.
Until the 1920s, most European high schools for girls were finishing schools.
In computational geometry it is a truism that problems in three-dimensional space, ℝ³, are significantly more difficult and complex than the corresponding problems in the two-dimensional plane, ℝ².

Rock armour was first used on the line "in a very small way" after floods in 2005, and more extensively last year when an embankment had to be reinstated. "The destructive problem with flooding is when water washes over the railway and runs down the other side," explains Hinshelwood. "If it keeps coming, it starts to accelerate, to scour and create turbulence, picking up ever-larger material the faster it washes across. You can't stop it, but rock armour slows it to a point where it doesn't wash ballast or embankment material away."

The choice of a Riemannian manifold - roughly speaking, a differentiable manifold whose every point has a tangent space with a defined metric - means it is possible to define a differential form over it.
Differential forms provide a unified approach to defining integrands over curves, surfaces and higher-dimensional manifolds, as well as providing an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.
The present text attempts to serve as an introduction to the differential form formalism applicable to electromagnetic field theory. A glance at Figure 1.2 on page 18, presenting the Maxwell equations and the medium equation in terms of differential forms, gives the impression that there cannot exist a simpler way to express these equations, and so differential forms should serve as a natural language for electromagnetism.

It's impossible to know how many people like Ruttan Walker have experienced climate despair as a mental health crisis, but despair is all around us: in our own momentary but intense reactions to the latest bit of climate news, in pitch-black memes and jokes about human extinction, even in works of philosophy and literature.
There appears to be a fine balance for educators between safeguarding the mental health of students who might feel climate despair on the one hand, and inspiring students to take personal climate action on the other by presenting the facts of this unprecedented and existential threat to humanity.
Although it is not an official clinical diagnosis, the psychiatric and psychological communities have names for the phenomenon: “climate distress,” “climate grief,” “climate anxiety” or “eco-anxiety.”

Really small organisms (viruses and rickettsia, for instance) aren’t motile (for reasons we will soon be able to guess), but we can explore the consequences of their hypothetical mobility by resorting to science fiction. In a classic example of Hollywood science, the cast of the film The Fantastic Voyage (1966) is placed in a submarine, reduced tremendously in size, injected into the blood stream of a human being, and asked to cruise to the brain to correct some malady.

Homotopy theory originated as a topic in algebraic topology, but is now studied as an independent discipline in its own right, and as a tool in fields including category theory and algebraic geometry.
This is our main result, deduced from the axioms of a cofibration category, which leads to many new theorems on the homotopy classification problems in topology and in various algebraic homotopy theories.

Her way of paying for these gift subscriptions was to choose one of her sows which was in a family way and, when the sow littered, to sell its offspring.
According to Weil [22], analytic number theory, which deals with inequalities and asymptotic formulas, is not number theory but analysis.
Three pregnancies occur in this novel: Nina, Fran and Danielle all find themselves in a family way.

A typical approach in the geometry of numbers is to view a ring of algebraic integers as a lattice in ℝⁿ; the study of these lattices provides fundamental information on algebraic numbers.
The geometry of numbers to which this book is devoted deals with arbitrary bodies and arbitrary lattices in the n-dimensional euclidean space. Its aim is to study various quantities describing the behaviour of a body with respect to a lattice.
My granny always runs her vegetables through the deflavorizing machine before allowing us to eat them.
The easy proof is obtained applying the pigeon-hole principle to 𝛼₁x_1+…+𝛼ₙx_n(mod 1)|x_i=0,…N, or by geometry of numbers by applying Minkowski's first theorem in C.2.19 to the symmetric convex body of volume 2ⁿ⁺¹ given by |X_0+𝛼₁X_1+…𝛼ₙX_n|<N⁻ⁿ,|X_i|<N,i=1,…N.
One major area of study in additive combinatorics is that of inverse problems: for instance, given the sumset A+B is small in size, what can we say about the structures of A and B? In the case of integer sumsets, Freiman's theorem provides a partial answer.

This book deals with additive combinatorics, a vibrant area of current mathematical research. Additive combinatorics—an offspring of combinatorial number theory and additive number theory—can be described as the study of combinatorial properties of sumsets (collections of sums with terms from given subsets) in additive structures.

Tzitzeica's classical papers are believed to have initiated a new area in mathematics, namely affine differential geometry. [ … ] The present paper extends the above-mentioned approach to affine differential geometry.
The Tzitzeica surfaces are the analogues of spheres in affine differential geometry and, indeed, are known as affine spheres or affinsphären [39]. According to Nomizu and Sasaki [227], the origins of affine differential geometry reside in this work of Tzitzeica at the turn of the nineteenth century.

For instance, progressions and lattices play a similar role in arithmetic combinatorics that balls and subspaces play in the theory of normed vector spaces.
I got a lot of brush offs. It was a part of the job.
Arithmetic combinatorics arose out of the interplay between number theory, combinatorics, ergodic theory and harmonic analysis. [ … ] One important technique in arithmetic combinatorics is the ergodic theory of dynamical systems.
The prime number theorem serves as a prototypical example of an idea generalised via abstract analytic number theory and adapted to other fields; the emphasis is on results pertaining to asymptotic analysis.

The oscillating strategies of annihilation, exclusionary containment, and assimilation with respect to Native Americans provide but one very poignant case and point.
A key tool in Nevanlinna theory is the Nevanlinna characteristic, T(r,f), which measures the rate of growth of a meromorphic function.
Information dissemination about the destruction of the Khamisiyah munitions depot in Iraq is a case and point.
Motivated by an analogy between Nevanlinna theory and Diophantine approximation theory, discovered independently by C. F. Osgood [Osg 1985] and P. Vojta [Vojt 1987], S. Lang recognized that the careful study of the error term in Nevanlinna'a Second Main Theorem would be of interest in itself.
Beginning with the work of Osgood [65], it has been known that the branch of complex analysis known as Nevanlinna theory (also called value distribution theory) has many similarities with Roth's theorem on diophantine approximation. [ … ] The circle of ideas has developed further in the last 20 years: Lang's conjecture on sharpening the error term in Roth's was carried over to a conjecture in Nevanlinna theory which was proved in many cases.
Let me put it this way: The girl in question was no novice to Washington nor to the ways of Capitol Hill.
At the same time, the failure of conservatives to invest in Capitol Hill lobbying that could be coordinated with their grass-roots efforts represents a strategic misallocation of resources.
The Ninety-fourth Congress would be emphatically Democratic, and Ford's base of support on Capitol Hill would be narrower and weaker.
I cannot count how many letters I received from Capitol Hill in the 1990s outlining one scheme or another to spend more or tax less
We know what’s sprouting, but Mantel’s trilogy lets us imagine that it might all have been different. Did Anne Boleyn’s neck have to meet the sword of an executioner brought from Calais to do her in? Did Thomas Cromwell have to cross the Styx himself four years later?
Bored with the emptiness of her life, she was said to be increasingly turning to the consolations of “mother's little helper”—new lines of tranquilizing drugs, such as Librium and Miltown, meant to soothe the female anxieties that Betty Friedan decried in her bestselling The Feminine Mystique.
A political reality of Capitol Hill is that the party in control has always taken care of its own and, as the minority sees it, gives them "the shaft."
Abstractly, additive number theory includes the study of abelian groups and commutative semigroups with an addition operation.
Additive number theory has close ties to combinatorial number theory and the geometry of numbers.
One of the famous theorems of additive number theory states that each positive integer is expressible in at least one way as the sum of the squares of not more than four positive integers.
Additive number theory is a very broad area within which lies the theory of partitions, and the subject of representation of integers as sums of squares, cubes, etc. There is a vast literature in additive number theory on problems of the following type: Given a subset A of the integers, when does it form a basis for the integers? That is, when can every positive integer be expressed as the sum of at most a (fixed) bounded number of elements of A?
However, I do not mean to imply all local status quos revolve around territorial arrangements, or territory only matters in terms of minerals within it.
The last section introduces elementary algebraic graph theory which is then applied to electrical networks.
Several famous results in algebraic graph theory, including one of the oldest, are formulae for the numbers of spanning trees of certain graphs.
After we have crossed the Glenderamackin stream, which drains the northern slopes of Saddleback, and the latter has united with the St. John's Beck to form the Greta, however, we see ahead the miniature canyon the Greta has hollowed out for itself, and into the depth of which the train now descends.
Recently hybrid methods are proposed by Kaveh [2] and Kaveh et al. [18] which employ graph and algebraic graph theories simultaneously for domain decomposition of FE meshes and their nodal ordering.
Mathematical tools such as hybrid dynamical systems, complex networks, differential equations, and algebraic graph theories are introduced for modeling and analyzing the hybrid intelligent networks.
I should imagine that the smooth riding and the quietness of the diesel or electric cab, coupled with the effect on the eyes of endless successions of sleepers disappearing from sight immediately under the driver's eyes, might in time have a soporific effect, so that the company of a second man, who can assist in signal observations when he is not at work in the engine cab, seems highly desirable in such conditions. In most countries using these forms of power, a second man is provided for on any train on which the maximum distance between stops exceeds a certain predetermined distance or time.

Talk to someone else about the problem. Some people call this “confessional debugging.” You often discover your own error in the act of explaining it to another person.
There are two more bits of strategy you might want to consider. Many programmers find “confessional debugging” to be one of the most useful techniques around. Confessional debugging works something like this: you grab your printouts and go into the next cubicle, interrupt the programmer working there, and say, [ … ]

If you have worked at a help desk, you have probably experienced the phenomena^([sic]) known as “confessional debugging.” A person is explaining the problem and as they do so, it suddenly dawns on them what the problem is. The act of explaining the code to someone makes you think a little more clearly, not skip steps, and so on. Confessional debugging is surprisingly effective.
The distinction between r rotunda and straight r has not been kept in the transcription, as the usage of r rotunda is predictable from the preceding character: r rotunda is used after round letters.
Programmers call the computer equivalent "confessional debugging." "Hey, Eric, can you look at this code? I can't understand why it doesn't--oh! Never mind."

Debuting on Soulelection's new Beats 1 program, the new track titled "B's & H's" was produced by Fisticuffs and is a sultry warning to any "bitches and hoes" who don't even know what they're in for with a guy who's "gonna fuck around and find out".
In essence, it was a dare to both Senate Republicans and the Supreme Court itself: fuck around and find out.
Since punishment (including death and prison in the United States) is the harshest type of public measure or burden that the state may take or impose against an individual and the state has the duty to consider the rights and interests of all people involved or affected by a situation (including those who cause harm), the ultima ratio principle requires that less harmful responses or measures, including noncriminal ones, be adopted if those responses or measures would adequately advance a legitimate goal such as addressing harmful behavior.

In their classical work [123], Kashiwara, Kawai, and Kimura pointedly observe that the Japanese algebraic analysis is really the algebraic analysis in the tradition of Euler; we may add that what we mean by algebraic microlocal analysis is the successful attempt to adapt the methods of abstract algebraic geometry to the non-commutative setting in which the base ring is now the ring of variable coefficients^([sic]) partial differential operators.

Journalists covering the story have tended to gesture towards possible impetuses, and there are undoubtedly many underlying factors that led to r/wallstreetbets’ choosing GameStop as a “meme stock”, which have surely evolved with the saga (screwing Wall Street; making money; a genuine belief in the fundamentals of GameStop’s business model).
Individual YOLO decisions can be chalked up to many factors: cabin fever, low interest rates, the emergence of new get-rich-quick schemes like NFTs and meme stocks.

Orgastic potency is the capacity to surrender to the flow of biological energy, free of any inhibitions; the capacity to discharge completely and the dammed-up sexual excitation through involuntary, pleasurable convulsions of the body.
The full implications of the pandemic on future demand for rail travel are yet to be borne out, although there is broad consensus that a pre-existing shift towards greater home working and less peak-time travel has been accelerated.
The confrontation of urban and rural lifestyles is the major source of fun in the novel which would be incomplete without due references to the WI where "tradition decreed that one should wear a tweedy A-line skirt with a delicious lemony-coloured twin set" (119), where one can get one's hand "on loads of those hand-knitted gnome families they always make" (118) and where new members are introduced into the mysteries of "how to knit Mrs Santa Claus or the Three Bears in lime green wool remnants" (118).
Establishment of orgastic potency brings about very definite changes in the individual — changes which are not properly recognized or understood by most psychiatrists even today. The recognition of orgastic potency was crucial.

Orgastic potency is always lacking in neurotic individuals. It presupposes the presence or establishment of genitality: that is, the absence of pathological character armor and muscular armor. Orgastic potency is usually, and erroneously, not distinguieshed from erective and ejaculative potency, both of which are prerequisites of orgastic potency.

Algebraic K-theory has two components: the classical theory which centers around the Grothendieck group K_0 of a category and uses explicit algebraic presentations and higher algebraic K-theory which requires topological or homological machinery to define.
Algebraic K-theory is a branch of algebra dealing with linear algebra over a general ring R instead of a field. [ … ] Algebraic K-theory plays an important part in many areas of mathematics, especially number theory, algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.
The basic idea of Grothendieck's anabelian geometry is that under certain "anabelian hypotheses" the étale fundamental group of a scheme contains all the geometric and arithmetic information about the scheme in discussion, that is to say, the scheme is functorially encoded in its étale fundamental group. Among these we shall discuss applications to the inverse Galois problem, Belyi's theorem on covers of the projective line minus three points and some advanced results on ‘anabelian geometry’ of curves.

But what ScotRail has now is a superb train that is fit for purpose. Turbostars were OK, certainly one of the best of the late 1990s glut of new designs. But were they really a good travel experience for 180 miles from Glasgow to Inverness? No, they were not (and I speak from experience). These HSTs offer a much better train for such a journey.
It may also seem unnecessary to take post mortem samples if infection is well documented pre mortem (as this is likely to be much more accurate); however, there is always a potential for litigation citing inadequate treatment of a known infection, in which case pre mortem and autopsy microbiology need to be compared to confirm the source of any fatal infection.

The baked Alaska, also known as the Norwegian omelet, is a confection that lives up to its name. (Pre-global warming, that is.) You take a slab of frozen ice cream, heap on a cloud of meringue, and cook it. When it's ready, the ice cream is still frozen, and the topping is touched with the golden caramel of melted sugar. Food historians believe this paradoxical treat began pleasing its adoring public sometime around the 19th century. The baked Alaska prototype is believed to be French in origin. Food historians agree that a dish similar to the baked Alaska appeared in France around the mid-1800s.

Definition. A field is algebraically closed when it satisfies the equivalent conditions in Proposition 4.1. □ For instance, the fundamental theorem of algebra (Theorem III.8.11) states that Complex is algebraically closed. The fields R , Q , Z ₚ, are not algebraically closed, but R and Q can be embedded into the algebraically closed field Complex .
[N]othing is easier than to make sure [ … ] that the horse selected, in the event of the public fancying him, shall be made a market horse, and be “milked” for the benefit of those interested: the losing of a race may at any time be ensured, and there are scores of “turf dairymen” who are reputed adepts in the use of the milking pail.
In many ways Q ₚ is analogous to R . For example, R is not algebraically closed. The exercises below show that Q ₚ is not algebraically closed. However, by adjoining i=√ to R , we get the field of complex numbers, which is algebraically closed. In contrast, the algebraic closure ◌̅ Q ₚ of Q ₚ is not of finite degree over Q . Moreover, Complex is complete with respect to the extension of the usual norm of R . Unfortunately, ◌̅ Q ₚ is not complete with respect to the extension of the p-adic norm. So after completing it (via the usual method of Cauchy sequences) we get a still larger field, usually denoted by Complex ₚ, and it turns out to be both algebraically closed and complete.

At a time when mobile phones and social media ensure we’re all familiar with what crime really looks like, our tolerance for embracing it as entertainment may be diminished. Likewise our indulgence of those who act as if they’re above the law. Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein – both are a bit of a cold shower for those who like to celebrate devil-may-care chutzpah.
Fascinating stuff, and I wanted more – lots more – but this little travelling show just touches on the terror and magic of seeing the otherworld. We jump cut from the 1920s to now and get a chaotic selection of contemporary takes on spiritualist art. Hiller aside, it’s like being hit by a cold shower of irony, wrecking the spooky mood.
President Trump turned up and took a cold shower of boos which his memory has not yet alchemized into thunderous applause and two models popped up behind home plate, pulled up their shirts and bared their breasts as Houston’s Gerrit Cole peered in at his catcher for a sign.

It is the privilege of the original thinker to put forward ideas which are new and usually unwelcome to the common clay.
‘You might just as well,’ continued she, ‘praise the carvings upon a Wycherley comb, so carefully preserved by the collectors of old china and such gimcracks.’
A comb made of South American tortoiseshell was found. These were used from the 17th century, hence the ‘Wycherley comb’, named after the dramatist William Wycherley (1641–1715).
The nose and proper left ear were also inset, stone restorations, with dark resin visible surrounding the joints.
`Two things are clear to me,' I said, addressing my three companions, who stared at this spectacle in dismay: `first, that we can't go across there' (I pointed to the swamp), `and, secondly, that if we stop here we shall certainly die of fever.' `That's as plain as a haystack, sir,' said Job.

Leo also was so much better that I yielded to Billali's often expressed entreaty, and agreed to start at once upon our journey to Kôr, which we were told was the name of the place where the mysterious She lived, though I still feared for its effect upon Leo, and especially lest the motion should cause his wound, which was scarcely skinned over, to break open again.

Work centers in Nanping (formerly called Yenping) where are located the Nanping General Hospital and a high school for boys and girls. The conference has about 50 churches and 3,000 members. This conference is in Free China. Refugee institutions from Foochow have been temporarily located within the Yenping Conference—the Hwa Nan College and Hwa Nan High School at Nanping, and the Anglo-Chinese College and Union Kindergarten Training School at Yankow.
This study abroad program is a lot less structured than most others I've looked at.
These pressures might lead to an eventual abandonment of Free China. And this possibility, I believe, is rooted, not in the issues themselves, but in a general public attitude full of danger for our China policy., I refer here to the fact that the attitudes of both the public and Congress are far more anti-Chinese Communist than they are pro-Free China. The public insists that Communist China is not worthy of admission to even such an utterly non-homogeneous community of nations as we have today. But we hold far less emphatic attitudes on Free China., . . ., The danger of such an inadequately informed opinion is clear. If our China policy remains rooted more in fear of Communist China than in support of Free China, we are far more likely to be susceptible to Communist blackmail and intimidation than to be aware of the vital need for cooperation with our allies, the Free Chinese.

We have got such foreign and fantastic field sports as lawn-tennis, polo, croquet, cricket, and the like—very excellent, I believe, and health-giving exercises in their way, still not racy of the soil, but rather alien, on the contrary, to it, as are, indeed, for the most part the men and women who first imported and still continue to patronise them.

In the stocking should be worn a sgian dubh, on the outer part of the right leg. The sgian dubh is a knife in a simple sheath.
For nearly half a century this gentle Scottish scholar [Alexander Carmichael] crisscrossed the meadows and moors, mountains and islands of northern Scotland, clad in full Highlands regalia, with kilt, sporran, and sgian dubh (dagger), a walking stick in his right hand and a notebook in his left, sleeping under the stars or in rude shepherds' huts, knocking at a cottage here and a manor house there, and courteously begging, when the door cracked open, for a chance to explain his quest. His mission was to seek out, collect, and preserve the vanishing Gaelic folklore—hymns and tales, incantations, and curses, and above all, prayers—of this remote Highlands region, where the corrosive culture of modernity had not yet won the day.
If you do not care if your knife appears a bit weaponlike, go for a sgian dubh style blade, but be sure to pick out a good one as most eBay sgian dubhs are practically nonfunctional replicas.
He changed up on Wilson after three fastballs and struck him out.
The sgian dubhs tucked into the top of the men's socks caught my fancy. Could those tiny knives cut someone or were they only decorative? Had anyone ever pulled out a sgian dubh at a Burns Night celebration and used it on a guest?

It strikes me that quite three-fourths of the shops of Inverness are devoted to the sale of articles of Highland costume. Their fronts are hidden by hangings of tartan cloth; the windows are decked with sporrans, dirks, cairngorm plaid-brooches, ram's head snuff[-]boxes, bullocks' horns and skean dhus.

When I first saw engravings of these seals, I took Patrick's to bear the Skene coat, as always known since—three skenes, points upwards, bearing three wolves' heads. The blades show but little, but this could well be, even with skenes dhu, if they were pushed right up to the skull: the heads, however, are far too small.

In its application, the company cited “diseconomies of scale,” inflation and the diversion of normal traffic by Laker's Skytrain as reasons for seeking the increases.

Although nearly all neutrons produced by fission are emitted as soon as the atom splits (within 10^-14 sec or so), a very small proportion of neutrons (0.65% for U-235, 0.25% for Pu-239) are emitted by fission fragments with delays of up to a few minutes. In delayed criticality these neutrons are required to maintain the chain reaction. These long delays mean that power level changes can only occur slowly. All nuclear reactors operate in a state of delayed criticality.

Although non-destructive reads are theoretically possible with FeRAM, the process - requiring illumination of the memory cells with UV light - is completely impractical for most purposes, favoring the more-practical (but destructive) method of forcing every cell to 0, seeing which cells produced a tiny current pulse, and writing back 1s to those cells.

Although ferroelectric RAM has many advantages over conventional DRAM, it does share one of DRAM's disadvantages: as with DRAM, reading a FeRAM cell is a destructive read process which erases any data in the cell. When using FeRAM for persistent nonvolatile storage, this destructive-read nature can potentially result in data loss or corruption if power to the device is suddenly lost during a read operation.

The basic goal of algebraic topology is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, although most usually classify up to homotopy (homeomorphism being a special case of homotopy).
Many people think teens who play violent video games are at an increased risk of becoming a violent criminal, especially a murderer, but scientific studies debunk this and indicate that this is not the case.
The classical liberal tradition that continues to animate much of our political and legal discourses also offers a justification for, and defence of, individual autonomy and its accompanying rights.
Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible.
