In the first six months of 2012, UNAMA verified 34 cases of Anti-Government Elements launching attacks against education facilities, staff and students, and other incidents impacting education. These included the burning of schools, targeted killings of teachers and staff, armed attacks on education facilities, occupation of schools and intimidation and closure of schools, particularly girls' schools. This represents a substantial increase in such incidents compared to the same period last year when UNAMA documented 10 similar instances.

Yet Georgian leaders persist in warning of the Kyrgyz scenario.

"We apologize for any confusion about today's " To the Point," which dealt with both the Penn State child-sex scandal and the issue of same-sex couples as foster or adoptive parents.

Then there is the question of authority: by what right does the US carry out targeted killings on foreign soil?

Yet the director's modernist appropriation of realism, or vice versa, and here the absolute flattening of distinctions between historical and filmic' realities', means that none of these highly tactile, at times seemingly' 3D' and increasingly virtual images culminating with Antonioni's first colour film are' beyond' reality. Rather, they strikingly yet most fittingly present the various' shocks' and radical modifications of familiar experience within this technologised, hyper-industrialised world, even as the viewer's gaze upon it is clearly very different to that of our troubled, closely felt yet never truly accessible protagonist.

Institutions such as universities, schools, hospitals, correctional facilities and military installations are uniquely suited to composting because they typically generate large quantities of organic materials and have land available for composting. Institutional composting can reduce disposal costs or, as is the case at many universities, provide opportunities for research and development of new compost technologies.

But you need to be stout or scrawny to be a redneck, although being neither doesn't disqualify you. The scrawny need to be of a scrawny type that used to be called wormy-looking, and the stout need to be of a certain porcine aspect that's rarely seen in this country outside of redneckery but that's common among Germans and Russians who derive from stolid peasant stock.

As I said: Read your bible. Isaiah wrote: "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel." And in the original text there is no mention of "virgin" but "young woman". Even more: The text referres to the clash of two kings-- both of them were already dead, when Jesus was born. 
I think that one can also draw faith, albeit in an odd way, from the blood libel, especially in its contemporary incarnation. In the entire global history of armed conflict, no nation has done remotely as much as Israel to minimize civilian (and even military) casualties amongst its enemies. Yet simultaneously, no nation receives remotely as much condemnation for killing civilians!

The Bush administration wisely eschewed regime change, a foreign policy whose objectives may be likened to making a better family out of an unhappy one next door.

White folks often have a hard time understanding that this entire subject is life-or-death serious to people of color from the get-go, not a progressive ideological abstraction like in the minds of whites, but a grinding daily reality fraught with concrete peril every bit as real and personal and emotional (if not more so because of its immediacy and violence) as the perceived impugning of a white person's reputation.

At the United Nations Millennium Summit, world leaders put development at the heart of the global agenda with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), setting clear targets for reducing poverty, disease, hunger, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women by 2015.

In order to sin you have to have a certain amount of knowledge and understanding, have a mind, have the ability to choose to do it or refrain from doing it.

but not every homicide is a murder. "Homicide " is the killing of one person by another person. " Murder" is a criminal legal concept, usually involving intentional killing of one person by another without justification. Killing of one person by another by accident, self-defense, or capital punishment are all homicides but are not murder; these either lack intent or are justified.
