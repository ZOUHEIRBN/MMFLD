In order to facilitate this, preliminary dance cards are issued, and for several weeks before the promenade men are busy in exchanging dances with one another.

Economics is a messy discipline: too fluid to be a science, too rigorous to be an art. Perhaps it is fitting that economists’ most-used metric, gross domestic product (GDP), is a tangle too. GDP measures the total value of output in an economic territory. Its apparent simplicity explains why it is scrutinised down to tenths of a percentage point every month.

For when a book is of absorbing interest without a single startling incident, without a murder, without even an elopement (except a very minor one mentioned in the first chapter), and deprived of the adventitious aids of railway accidents, shipwrecks, or other dii ex machina, we may be sure that there is much nature and much thought in it.

Consider a simple digital circuit which has a two-bit input (X, Y) and a two-bit output (X and Y, X or Y). Assuming that the two input bits X and Y have mutually independent chances of 50% of being HIGH, then the input combinations (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) each have a 1/4 chance of occurring, so the circuit's Shannon entropy on the input side is H(X,Y)=4 Big (-1/4 log ₂1/4 Big )=2. Then the possible output combinations are (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1) with respective chances of 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 of occurring, so the circuit's Shannon entropy on the output side is H(XandY,XorY)=2 Big (-1/4 log ₂1/4 Big )-1/2 log ₂1/2=1+1/2=1 1/2, so the circuit reduces (or "orders") the information going through it by half a bit of Shannon entropy due to its logical irreversibility.

She has not begun to stem the tide of British ugliness—the yobbish teenagers shivering in their torn gear; the shoddy streets littered with fast-food packaging; the drunks urinating on London's tube platforms; the drug culture. It is facile to call those concerned “Thatcher's children”: she is not responsible for their actions.

London's financial district, like New York's, had its “big bang,” after which, as though from dragon's teeth, Yuppies sprang up, armed with Porsches and mobile telephones. They included, inevitably, some unattractive specimens, and much of their wealth has proved evanescent. To call them “Thatcher's children” is both unfair and unhistorical. Just the same corner-cutting, money-obsessed types can be found in the novels of Trollope and Galsworthy. At the other end of the scale are the workers in moribund industries, the unmarried mothers, and the feckless young, all those who have come to expect more from the welfare state than the welfare state could ever provide: They too are called “Thatcher's children”: but their problems would have existed whatever government was in power.

Peak organisations are not at all typical in the U.S., but the economic discourse that increasingly dominates much of regulation, and certainly, the raison d′etre for privatisation, narrows the discourse in such a way as to make most groups sound essentially the same.

The per se cause of the house is the building skill and the craftsman who exercises it, while the per accidens cause is the fair-skinned or the artistic man. Alexander says: 'Aristotle says that just as anything that exists is one thing per se and another per accidens (by “being what it is per se” he means the substance, and by "what is per accidens" he means the attributes of the substance), so a cause is one thing per se and another per accidens.

They hold to the impossibility of an actual per se infinity, because in a per se series the effects have a dependence on their causes, in which case if the series were infinite, the ultimate effect would be dependent on an infinite chain of causes; and since an infinity cannot be traversed, the being of such an effect would never be explained.

“Yes,” said Dr Fairbairn. “Very. And then there’s the interesting question of those who use the third person about themselves.” “Oh,” said Irene, vaguely. It occurred to her that she used the third person on occasion when talking to Bertie. She said things such as: “Mummy is watching, Bertie.

What did this reveal about Irene? she asked herself. No, deliberate play; what does that reveal about me?
She laughs when Mum calls herself a clog wog, and says they′re okay, just as buttoned-up as Anglo-Saxons.

The condition of Scribonius’ text thus raises nagging doubts about the authenticity of “o bone deus.” But even if the digression itself could be accepted as genuine, the situation does not improve, for the near uniqueness of Scribonius’ “o bone deus” makes it vulnerable to any number of possible accidents of transmission. Under these conditions it seems we are forced to set Scribonius aside as a non liquet.

Considered even more broadly, the historical background of pillage is also directly relevant to the current state of a country's cultural heritage and thus should be an integral part of the deliberations of the CPAC [Cultural Property Advisory Committee], especially in determining whether the cultural patrimony of the requesting country is "in jeopardy from pillage."

Who does not understand, as single parts of speech, all the common combinations which serve to connect and carry on construction, such as in-consequence-of, on-this-account, …, and the like? Indeed, we are entitled to say of ordinary common-place speakers, that as they scarcely use constructed language except in forms already existing, so, with them, each thought finds an immediate sign in some familiar sentence; but then, be it observed, the parts which compose the sign have ceased to be separately significant: the sentences so used have been brought back to the condition of original or natural language, that of exclamations, — they have ceased to be logical, by having become purely rhetorical.

What we ordinarily term language is made up of vocal signs of an arbitrary character, with corresponding written signs.

The Circle Method is a beautiful idea for studying many problems in additive number theory. It originated in investigations by Hardy and Ramanujan [HR] on the partition function P(n), the number of ways we can write n as a sum of positive integers. Since then it has been used to study problems in additive number theory ranging from writing numbers as sums of primes or k^( mathsf )th powers (for fixed k) to trying to count how many twin primes there are less than x.

Dating and courtship provide many examples of indirect communications. The young man may want sexual intercourse. The young woman may want marriage. In the initial stages of the dating game neither knows just what the other wants. Hence, they do not know precisely what game they are going to play.

Hinting and alluding thus become indispensable methods of communication.

The new challenge to free will comes from a different direction: neuroscience's discovery that people's brains are a collection of diversely oriented modules, and that our understanding of our own intentionality is to a great degree a legitimating fiction which one module in the left hemisphere of the brain retroactively imposes over the decisions different modules make.

The literary revival in the native language stemmed from the need to communicate the ideas of the enlightenment to as wide a public as possible. Akhundzadä, who throughout most of his life composed lyric poetry in Persian, when writing works that carried a message of social importance used a language comprehensible to all his countrymen, which he called Türki. The renaissance of a native literature, a by-product of the movement, was thus its first and most tangible accomplishment. The hold of Persian as the chief literary language in Azerbaijan was broken, followed by the rejection of classical Azerbaijani, an artificial, heavily Iranized idiom that had long been in use along with Persian, though in a secondary position.
Race may therefore not be the only determining factor in the allocation, but race may be considered as a plus factor that may be taken into account.

Tremendous let her extend her name abroad to the extremest boundaries of the earth, where the middle ocean separates Europe from Africa, where the swollen Nile waters the plains; deriving more bravery from the contempt of gold yet undiscovered, and so best situated while hid in the earth, than from forcing it out for the uses of mankind, with a hand ready to make depredations on every thing that is sacred.

A primitive element of a Hopf algebra is an element h∈H such that 𝛥h=1⊗h+h⊗1. It is easily seen that the bracket [x,y]:=xy-yx of two primitive elements is again a primitive element. It follows that primitive elements form a Lie algebra. For H=U(g) any element of g is primitive and in fact using the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Win theorem, one can show that the set of primitive elements of U(g) coincides with the Lie algebra g.

[…] blasting operations by a Swiss mining company in the Swiss Alps cause a snow avalanche in the French Alps injuring a group of English tourists. […] The lex loci damni rule [of the Rome II regulation] does not produce good results in […] cross-border torts in which the state of conduct prescribes higher standards of conduct for the tortfeasor than the state of injury. Suppose for example that, in the above snow avalanche hypothetical, Switzerland imposes a negligence per se rule on mining operators who engage in blasting activities in certain areas or time periods, while France, in order to protect its mining industry, follows an ordinary negligence standard. In such a case, Article 4(1) calls for the application of French law and specifically excludes Swiss law. In contrast, if this were an environmental tort, Article 7 would allow the victim to opt for Swiss law.

Thus all plots and prophecies become possible — the capacity to reduce cognitive dissonance is the cement of the cult when it confronts reality, and this is why the layman is helpless before the nonsense that is spread by these speeches.
The call will be answered with a high-pitched tone; no human voice will be heard. The phone receiver should be placed in the acoustic coupler, if one is used, with the cord in the proper position.
By turning over all their possessions, members were making an irreversible commitment to the cult. Once such a commitment is made, people are unlikely to abandon positive attitudes toward the group (Festinger, Riecken, & Schachter, 1982). After expending so much effort, questioning commitment would create cognitive dissonance (Osherow, 1988). It is inconsistent to prove devotion to a belief by donating all of your possessions and then to abandon those beliefs. In other words, to a large extent, cult members persuade themselves.

Much of the research literature has reintroduced classic cognitive dissonance theory to provide theoretical justification for a sequence of behavior change–belief change. The focus has been upon maintenance of conversion within groups when prophecy appears to fail.
As a low-level experience of cognitive dissonance, how does one maintain faith in an organization when some of the most basic claims are contradicted by evidence and ordinary experience?

If we were nominating the Sacred Wood to the National Register and said “The Sacred Wood is significant because it was here that God told Joseph Smith where to find the golden tablets that contained God’s revealed word about the Levites, Nephites, and Jesus Christ in the New World,” the Register would do very well to look at our nomination askance, because we’d be asking the U.S. government to validate the doctrine of the LDS churches. If instead we said that “The Sacred Wood is significant because in the traditions of the LDS churches it was here that God told Joseph Smith where to find the tablets containing the Book of Mormon, which led to the creation of the LDS churches, which are of great cultural importance to those who subscribe to their beliefs,” the Register could be much more comfortable about accepting our nomination.

Her supreme charm was the simplicity that comes of taking it for granted that people are born with carriages and country-places: it never occurred to her that such congenital attributes could be matter for self-consciousness, and she had none of the nouveau riche prudery which classes poverty with the nude in art and is not sure how to behave in the presence of either.

Aggiss and Cowie are smash and grab artists, eclectically borrowing from a range of different dance and performance styles and making them into their own inimitable blended form.

According to many ancient Mayan esoteric beliefs, Alcyone is the central star of the Pleiadian star system, and our sun is the outermost star of this system. The Mayan Great Cycle is a calendar that delineates the [26,000]-year-long orbit of our sun and solar system around Alycone. According to the latest discoveries in astronomy, our sun is moving into a "photon belt," or belt of light particles. As we move deeper and deeper into this photon belt, it would seem that we are moving into the Age of Light described in many ancient prophecies as well as by the Mayans. My latest theory about the photon belt, which combines science, astrology, esoteric sources, and secret information given to me by indigenous people, is that we cyclically travel through this belt of light for [2000] years and then travel outside of it for about [11,000] years.

Even during the Vietnam War, in the Pentagon Papers case, a standing objection would not have barred the assertion of a Nuremberg defense by those who committed the civil disobedience.
The American judiciary's narrow interpetation of the standing requirement under the Nuremberg Principles has eviscerated the Nuremberg defense and limited its application to a narrow range of cases. … The judiciary, in rejecting defendants' standing to raise the Nuremberg defense, ignores the recognized privilege of citizen intervention to prevent the commission of a crime.

A quick scanning of the Australian Aboriginal literature on ‘message sticks’ indicates that it has been fashionable since at least the 1880s (for example, Howitt 1899) to interpret them as mnemonic devices for their bearers, who delivered the message verbally, plus perhaps asome totemic symbol to vouch for the bona fides of the bearer or the sender. Conversely, Yolngu assert that message sticks (balarm) themselves did (and still can) convey information about the precise time that, say, a ceremony is planned, as well as how many people were invited and expected to attend.

WASHINGTON: The common American household Dust Bunny has been designated as an endangered species, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USF&WS) announced last week. "The widespread use of household cleaning products and devices has drastically reduced the habitat of the Dust Bunny," said Noah Present, Acting Director of the Endangered Species Program. "American homes are cleaned too frequently, and much better than in the past." / "We are not to blame for the improper use of our products," responded a spokesman for the Household Products Association. "Correctly used, many of the Dust Bunnies should survive."
About 3.6 billion years ago, the sun and its planets coalesced from a cloud of stellar debris, probably helped along by the push from the explosion of a nearby supernova. The particles of cosmic dust began sticking together by static electricity, the same force that forms dust bunnies under your bed. Eventually, the particles got big enough for gravity to start pulling more pieces together.

The same propagation through the same ether brought the rays of the sun's light from the sun to the earth, and the same carrier wave brought from the other side of the globe, from the oceans there, which were disturbed by the attraction of the sun and moon, those waves all round the coasts which were called tides. All these phenomena, from the tides and the wind to the rays of light and to the sounds of the telephone, were the motion of one simple phenomenon, the carrier wave, the wave of translation.
Noise is caused by a shock or stroke or beat given to some mass of matter. The shock tells on the mass of air near the struck body. It sends this mass of air into a heap near the struck body. This heap forms an air wave. … This wave is the carrier of the shock through great distances in the air, it travels with great speed. This "carrier wave" takes the shock of the stroke from afar, to the ear of the listener.

Mr. [John Scott] Russell not only observed the shape and characteristics of the wave, which he called the carrier wave, or wave of translation, but he noticed the form which water assumed in filling up a cavity; and one of the means he used for this purpose was to have a boat towed at moderate and also at high velocities, and to observe the waves which followed her. These waves he found to be different from carrier waves, and he calls them following waves, or waves of replacement.

[M]eans must be taken first to create a series of solitary waves, and then to make these waves act as carrier waves, transporting the sounds from the instrument to the ear at a distance. In other words, the operation carried on in the instrument differs from the operation carried on through the air and from the effect delivered by the carrier wave.

The disease incidence appeared to have a cyclic course. After an outbreak, the disease and virus disappeared and the herd immunity gradually waned in the next 2 to 3 years. A new outbreak was the consequence of the reintroduction of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV).
Herd immunity is based on the notion that if a herd (a population or a group) is mostly protected from a disease by immunization then the chance that a major epidemic will occur is limited. Jonas Salk, one of the developers of the polio vaccine, suggested that if a herd immunity level of 85% exists in a population, a polio epidemic will not occur. Herd immunity is also viewed as the resistance a population has to the invasion and spread of an infectious disease.

As early as the 1870s, most theaters allowed African Americans to sit in designated areas, while the dress and parquet circles were reserved for whites. A few theaters did not allow blacks at all. In the early 1920s, black leaders protested these “peanut galleries” on the grounds that African Americans paid the same ticket price. A boycott was organized that resulted not only in the closing of the peanut galleries but also closing of the theaters to blacks altogether. It was not until the public accommodations drive in the early 1960s that all theaters were opened to blacks. On May 14, 1963, the Louisville Board of Aldermen passed the public accommodations law that made discrimination in all public facilities illegal.

In the production of a statue of Athena for the Parthenon, the bronze is the material cause; the shape and design of the statue is the formal cause; the sculptor is the efficient cause; the honor of the goddess (and the glory of Athens) is the final cause.

In witch-trials the conflict was officially defined as between the accused and God, or between the accused and the Catholic (later Protestant) church, as God's earthly representative. There was no attempt to make this an even match. The distribution of power between accuser and accused mirrored the relations between king and serf—one had all the power and the other none of it.

The first magazine solely devoted to horror was the long-running pulp Weird Tales (1923–54), where Lovecraft and his disciples published much of their work. their very appearance in this magazine has been held as a mark against them, but it was at this juncture that the supernatural (even in the form of the innocuous Christmas ghost story) became generally banished from mainstream periodicals, so that these writers had no other markets to peddle their wares. Whether the existence of the pulp magazines engendered this banishment, or whether changes in literary fashion triggered the scorning of non-mimetic fiction from mainstream magazines, is a question that has not been satisfactorily answered.

A certain amount of collateral damage and destruction to the surrounding environment has always been viewed as a necessary but generally undesirable by-product of military conflict.
The early aubades and tagelieder in particular are just full of noble knights who nonetheless are a rather randy lot and never pass up the chance for a good roll in the hay with an unhappily married noblewoman.
Merely the existence of collateral damage – whether in war or in a managerial situation - is symptomatic to me of misdirected power and synonymous with a failing in the exercise of power.

Too many don'ts had crimped their creativity and blocked out the wealth of dos. I admire the high standards embraced by my Christian students, but my heart also aches for those who have been raised to simply color inside the lines.
In all of these cases, the explicit goal is to ensure that children and teenagers will colour inside the lines, that their behaviour will stay within boundaries set by parents, educators, regulators, policy makers and/or technology developers.

Affirmative action and the pussy pass in all matters costs men not only in terms of their rights, identity and dignity, but it costs women in terms of their psychological and emotional development.

By focusing on the medium rather than the message, the pottery rather than the pattern, the typeface rather than the tale, philosophers who claim that something ineffable about carbon's chemistry is indispensable for consciousness miss the boat.

Over 25 per cent of the 463 women who were sentenced to death at the Old Bailey pleaded the belly between 1674 and 1699, and 38 per cent from 1700 to 1724, though a much smaller proportion did so later.
We spent a long time looking for a cheaper deal, but we ended up buying from the first dealer we met.
Stick to music that has lots of harmony, and if you ever meet your mirror image, don't try to out-pick him and don't take him grouse hunting. It becomes dueling banjos.
“Corn and soybeans are the dueling banjos of conventional agriculture that amount to little more than subsidized erosion,” says Thicke, laughing at his own critique.
"My third command to the Winged Monkeys," said Glinda, "shall be to carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore."
The governments new proposals intend to make the following changes and introductions: … Placing underperforming council planning departments into “special measures” and allowing developers to bypass them if they fail to improve.
The horn-fueled title track gave Parliament their first Top 10 appearance on the Billboard R&B charts, doing James Brown proud with its stuttering funk groove, its singalong chorus imploring us all to “Get up for the downstroke.”
The second those iconic beats dropped, we knew it was time to “get up for the downstroke.”
If the term “daytime TV” used to be synonymous with slightly ramshackle, undemanding programming attuned to the languid circadian rhythms of hungover students and the retired, it’s now a hyper-competitive arena of mechanical oneupmanship, a Hunger Games for image and sound editors.

With nakedness we find quite often the opposite of what the revealer expects to accomplish: the girl cladly dressed receives attention she is seeking but at cost to how she is perceived, a boy exposing his inner garment is unaware of the spiritual ramifications, news of infidelity or a checkered past leads to depression, possibly suicide and brings more harm to those surrounding the target.
Since the Lions only play outside the British Isles or these islands, the opportunity for Irish nationalists to insist that the former description should not be used has not been taken.
Same-sex marriage proposals have been greenlit in Jersey and Guernsey - meaning that Northern Ireland is the only remaining part of these islands where marriage equality continues to be blocked.
The President: 'Hello... I am still on the lam from debt collectors.'

It's the 2015 General Election's Portillo moment - but who is the Tory who's scalped shadow chancellor Ed Balls by just 422 votes?
There have been more bank runs, executives on the lam, arrests and credit panics than the country has seen in years.
We have to separate ourselves from Homo Aristophaneus of the 5ᵗʰ century B.C. The crucial difference is the use of pejorative language which we define as verbal references to certain areas of the human body which are considered social taboo – and therefore must be hidden, for we consider them "dirty". For Athenians, this was not something to be said in a euphemistic way, but as something to be enjoyed and talked about, as the human body was always available as a healthy and important part of life.
George, known as Steady Eddie during his 10 years in charge at Threadneedle Street, said critics who attacked the Financial Services Authority were also wide of the mark.
The single event that forced Christianity to dance to a different tune was Darwin's great 1859 book called On the Origin of Species.

Monetary policy may not be perfect, but it has been far better handled since the responsibility for it moved from 11 Downing Street to Threadneedle Street.
They even made the mistaken assumption, mainly from the title, that the song had some kind of lesbian message. As Heike put it: 'You can't expect the subliterate cockwombles on the Daily Heil showbiz and gossip desks to have read Orwell.'
The Bank of England cut 0.25 per cent at each meeting - the same decision, spread over two months. Strip out that and Frankfurt and Threadneedle Street have been running the same policy for a year and a half.

My reader will not wonder, that, after having ascertained the superior goodness of dephlogisticated air by mice living in it, and the other tests above mentioned, I should have the curiosity to taste it myself.
Tracker: I got the lens working from 17 to 85mm, but aperture control and AF gave up the ghost. Just bought a replacement 17-85mm at Futureshop in St John's. Oldguywithacamera: Yikes! Like the Newfs say, "The arse is gone right out of 'er" warranty?
She [Potiphar's wife] then played the rape card, and Joseph was thrown into prison. If I had been Joseph, I would be thinking, Hey, God, You gave me those dreams! Look at me now.
Priestley never swayed from his firm conviction in the phlogiston theory as long as he lived, and he called his new gas ‘dephlogisticated air’.
We'll spin it that you and me were having a friendly chat over a pint, and you just happened to mention the victim hiring you to find a necklace.

I was last Saturday much pleased in witnessing a company of active young men playing the manly and athletic game of “base ball” at the Retreat in Broadway (Jones’)
Somebody belches or farts. Somebody else says, usually primly, More tea, Vicar?'.

The sales team sought to talk to the movers and shakers within an organization, rather than to their underlings.
I can recall many an evening sitting in the store with the store manager and perhaps also with the wife of a farmer until midnight when the saloon closed, waiting for the men to stop by for their cream cans, egg crates and wives.
Happily this situation can be helped to a great extent by the use of grids called egg crates, which prevent the light from spreading too broadly.
They passed alder swamps and bamboo groves and pale green reindeer moss.
Lortie coined the phrase "egg crate school," which refers to a type of organization wherein "each teacher was assigned specific areas of responsibility and was expected to teach students the stipulated knowledge and skills without assistance from others."
As you can see from the test reports, in the lower frequency ranges in particular, egg crates offer little value for absorption.
Exterior shading devices can be either horizontal, vertical, or a combination of horizontal and vertical called “egg crates.”

The choice of the Aloha Camps was a happy one; but Mrs. Gulick should be designated as camp director instead of camp mother. Camp mother is used to designate the person in charge of midgets at a boys' camp.
Here we were met by a rugged individual in khaki shorts and football jersey who introduced herself as Panther-in-Chief, the camp mother to whom we could go with all our troubles.
Claire was sent away to a subcamp, and another camp mother, called Rosanne Lascroux, looked after Stella for a time.
There followed standard questions to establish Carter’s bona fides, his length of experience and seniority.
[H]olidays were my most unpleasant time; for my mother, who never loved me, now apprehending that I had the greater share of my father’s affection, and finding, or at least thinking, that I was more taken notice of by some gentlemen of learning, and particularly by the parson of the parish, than my brother, she now hated my sight, and made home so disagreeable to me, that what is called by school-boys Black Monday, was to me the whitest in the whole year.

And we go to extra innings.
At Tarves in 1684 the tradesmen valuators referred to mason work, dry-stone work, mud work, cassie work (cobbling), fail and divot work.
Distinguished farts in this category included the Piffy Farts - These were close to silent farts in that their sound was barely audible. As the name illustrates, the sound made was 'piff'. They may be compared to the bum burp of the household cat.
We have an early innings deficit to make up.

Whether death refers to biological death or serves as a metaphor for oppression and marginalization (social death), the potential for collective reconciliation with death is linked to his identity as a nigga living thug life.
The second segment is one of the most audacious and ambitious in “Treehouse Of Horror” history, and not just because it’s in black and white. It’s a parody of King Kong that works spectacularly well because Homer isn’t just ape-like and simian on the inside: he’s ape-like and simian on the outside as well, so it’s not too much of a stretch to imagine the rage-filled man-child as a giant ape with serious anger-control issues.
Like I said, China is game on if India wants to up the ante.
She is the sweetest-tempered, honestest, worthiest, young creature ; indeed, as to her beauty, I do not commend her on that account, though all men allow she is the handsomest woman, gentle or simple, that ever appeared in the parish.
Gentle or simple, man or woman, never came in for flattery at his hand, and hence his criticism of Lady Charlotte's work is worth pages of eulogistic comment.

The type of graph studied in graph theory is formally described as an ordered pair G=(V,E) comprising a set V of vertices, or nodes, and a set E of pairs (either ordered or unordered) of vertices, each representing an (directed or undirected) edge; if desired, the vertices and/or edges can be labelled.
Whereas radio dramas and comedies encouraged audiences to gather around the home set in rapt attention to unfolding narratives, the restructuring of programming around short, autonomous “singles,” played in repeating cycles, seemed immediately ideal for providing "soundtracks" for both quick car trips and long cross-country drives.
In graph theory there are two concepts of "sameness" whereby graphs are judged to be "the same", namely equality and isomorphism. [ … ] An indication of the pervasive role isomorphism has in graph theory is the fact that isomorphism has virtually captured the word "is".

Not for an instant do I wish to imply all show homer men would act so contemptibly, though it is a fact this has been done, and may be done again, unless the name is altered from the workinghomer to something that will readily distinguish the real article from the one that owns a title so apt to mislead.
And all the other pigeoneers I knew were obsessed homer men who cared only about racing.
The entity-level approaches build an internal representation for text units and their relationships, and use graph theories to determine the significance of units.
Given how difficult and complicated it can be to keep a room heated to hot yoga levels, it could be quite pricey.
Galloway and Thacker's own dissatisfaction with the graph theories of network science, for example, point to a tendency to attribute unfettered and apolitical naturalness to what are in effect asymmetrical topological spaces.

The advantage of performing a simulation is that different tail risk measures can be computed from the simulated loss distribution.
Chapter 3 has shown a method that makes use of a graphical formulation employing graph theories for performing the computation of both kinematic quantities (i.e. angular velocities of the center of mass of links, but also linear and angular acceleration), and dynamic (internal forces on the connection elements between the links, but also externally applied wrenches).

The Government requested that the applications be partly struck out of the list of cases in accordance with Article 37 § 1 (c) of the Convention, challenging the right of the heirs of the four applicants who had died in the course of the proceedings (Mr Hristozov, Mr Petrov, Ms Pencheva and Mr Behar, see paragraph 4 above) to pursue the applications in their stead. In their view, those heirs could not claim to be indirect victims, and did not have a valid interest in obtaining a ruling by the Court, because the alleged breaches of Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the Convention did not affect them, for two reasons. First, the authorities’ refusal to allow the applicants access to the unauthorised medicinal product that they wished to have administered did not affect other individuals, such as their heirs. Secondly, the rights invoked by the applicants were deeply personal in nature. Moreover, it was not the Court’s task to determine in the abstract whether the relevant domestic law provisions were in line with the Convention.
It's no use to ask him; he doesn't really know.

Conventional statistical analyses presuppose that intrinsic variability is white noise. White noise yields a jagged and irregular line with a fractal dimension of 1.5, because successive observations are statistically independent of each other.
The rise of growth hacking is largely responsible for it. Sean Ellis, a startup advisor who coined the term, put it like this: "The #1 requirement for effective, sustainable growth hacking is to start with a 'must have' product experience."

It is an instance of begging the question to argue that God can only do good deeds because God is good.
Let me hazard a guess: Yam cakes are made from yam, something that grows underground like a potato.
This recipe can be adapted to make yam cake. Replace the daikon with 300 g (11 oz) peeled taro. Skip Step 4 and instead steam the taro unitil just soft, then break it roughly into chunks and small bits while it is still hot. Stir it into the batter with the sausages and dried prawn mixture in step 5 and proceed with the recipe as above.
But the thing which is called begging the question, is the making use of the very point, that is the thing in debate, or the thing to be proved, as an argument to prove itself.

Büsingen was mentioned amid talk of Britain following the example of Switzerland: outside the EU but with access to its single market through bilateral agreements that accept, among other things, freedom of movement for EU citizens. That all ended abruptly when British prime minister Theresa May steered the UK towards a hard Brexit, promising to prune back EU ties to a minimum to ensure maximum domestic control over borders.
Labour's vision for a soft Brexit would have seen Britain remain closely aligned with the EU customs, tariff and regulatory regimes and the continent's single market. Such a relationship would have meant that Britain would continue to allow EU migrants to live and work in the United Kingdom, while withdrawing from the EU legislature.
A router, by definition, cannot carry isochronous traffic such as voice.

The novice surf caster should consider graphite because its lighter weight and better casting ability will help him learn the basics of the sport without becoming discouraged by awkwardness in the tackle.
While it is certainly true that the angler's physical size confers some advantage with regard to achieving a long cast, most surf casts will be well short of the distances (500 to 600 feet) reached by professional casters in tournaments.
Indeed, surf casting is the lowest-percentage fishing technique you might choose, other than, say, scooping fish bare-handed.

The fundamental principle of found art is the fact that the source of the esthetic impulse is found not in the objet d'art but in the eye of the beholder of the objet d'art.
You shouldn't operate heavy machinery without a licence.
Found art is created when odd, disparate, unlikely, even long-abandoned castoffs are put together with other similarly unexpected remnants to create something new and, if all goes as planned, lovely.
Some prominent critics even speak of “platform capitalism” – a broader transformation of how goods and services are produced, shared and delivered.
Unlike plain old cigarettes and their image as stinky sticks chock-full of cancer, cigars evoke an image befitting leather chairs, pinstriped suits, and dry martinis. Not that you have to wear a pinstriped suit and sip a martini to enjoy one.

Montezuma's Revenge, everybody knows, is the persistent intestinal illness that spoils the good humour of tourists in the tropics. Could there be a Montezuma's Revenge of the soul? There could. We caught it.
His mother had died within a year after his return; his wife and newborn son, both from influenza, in 1916 when Francine was four. Now the two of them rattled around in the old house, even with his office and small clinic sharing the downstairs with the kitchen, parlor, and dining room.
There's a lot of flu bugs floating around. I think it is commendable that he thought enough of his fellow senators to keep his diseases to himself. I don't know what he had, but I suspect it was Montezuma's Revenge. (Mexico is the only country in th world where the expression "Royal Flush" has nothing to do with playing cards.)
Garrison life and close order drills had never been my forte.
One reason for the survival of old-fashioned close-order drill is that prolonged movement in unison arouses a strong psychological response and creates an esprit de corps among those who drill together that pays off even on modern battlefields.
President Jimmy Carter arrived in Mexico City for a state visit on February 14, 1979, and proceeded to recall for his hosts a previous encounter with Mexican culture, decades earlier as a naval officer, in which he had contracted what he described as "Montezuma's revenge." This indelicate reference to tourist's diarrhea became something of an international incident; Mexican Preident José López Portillo insisted that his country be treated with respect, while the local press denounced the remark as a "typical Yankee slur."
Contrary to orders, the trucks closed in upon each other and sometimes even raced side by side, despite the extended-order drill.

This agreement codified nuclear apartheid, leaving in place three types of nuclear states: the five recognized nuclear powers (the United States, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union), NATO and Warsaw Pact allies with access to nuclear weapons but not ownership, and a large class of non-nuclear states who renounced their right to go nuclear.
There's barely a week that goes by without me going nuclear about something or other to do with middle age as portrayed in the media.
So Lyell's view is not inconsistent with Dollo's Law of Irreversibility in that, under awful (i.e., evolutionary) changes, biological organisms would not follow the same unlikely path regenerating, say, DNA-exact Tyrannosaurus rexes from ancestral chicken stock in some future age.

Now before some of you spazz out, be assured my kids know I cry and they wipe the tears away.
While general “calling out” can be about anything at all, the callout culture addressed in this article relates specifically to social justice communities and admits to the tendency of some social justice activists to see calling out as "an end in itself."

In 1919, when Roy Allen and Frank Wright started selling their new root beer beverage to a thirsty America, national Prohibition was taking its grip on the country. Their timing couldn't have been better. No longer able to legally drink real beer, thirsty patriots had to settle for this sweet, foamy conoction derived from roots, herbs, and berries.

For Paul Klein, as astute an observer as there was inside television, the defining programming trend of the time was sex, particularly in the form of "jiggle television."
The cops have picked up the man they were looking for.
A jiggle TV programme consists of the following essential elements: (1) leading roles played by glamorous and improbably pneumatic young women (some of whom were surgically enhanced for the purpose); (2) scanty costumes, which allow the jiggling to be appreciated to its greatest advantage; and (3) a plot which necessitates jiggling, and may be far-fetched but not so complicated as to distract the audience from (1) or (2).

The "schizoanalysis" of Deleuze and Guattari further brings the film into conversation with Gregory Bateson's analysis of schizophrenia and the environment in Steps to an Ecology of Mind, wrapping up with an examination of the film as a product of late capitalism.
Those cerebral outlets helped to fuel renewed interest in Marx and critical theory, as well as late capitalism. David Graeber, a leading figure in Occupy and the coiner of the phrase “We are the 99 percent,” for instance, wrote a long essay for The Baffler that touched on Jameson, Mandel, corporate profitability, flying cars, and, of course, late capitalism.

Fred came from Cheapside in London – an official Cockney, born within earshot of the bells of St. Mary-le-Bow – and he taught her Cockney rhyming slang. She loved its lighthearted logic: the last word in a common phrase rhymed with the word it was to replace. So "tit for tat" was "hat", and "trouble and strife" was "wife". But the best part was that you usually dropped the rhyming words and used only the first words, so "your wife's hat" became "your trouble's titfer".]

Before examining the French experience, it would seem useful to consider some of the major differences and similarities between the French war and the American war in Vietnam. The areas of combat and the type of warfare, the composition of the armed forces, the bargaining power of the adversaries and their dissimilar set of values, were all factors that affected, in one way or another, the numbers of killed in action, missing in action, prisoners of war, died in captivity, and bodies recovered.

The season of salad days has been rightly called a season of folly—rightly, because nature wisely intended salad days for folly, and we are wise to regard them as a time for folly.

We have these clubs colloquially called "siam diu" loosely translated as a sort of disco where the girls there are basically there to accompany/drink/play games/entertain the customers at their tables/sofas.

The ilio tibial (IT) band isn't a muscle; it's a thick strip of much less elastic tissue called fascia, a fibrous material similar to tendons and ligaments. The IT band begins on the outer hip and connects to the leg bones at the outer knee, and its primary function is to stabilize your knee. Most yoga teachers, myself included, think it's not a good idea to stretch fascia. These tissues receive much less blood than muscle does, which means that even small tears heal slowly and the scarring makes [ … ]

Some physicists claim that the dominant research program, designed to overcome this situation, is not really science at all. As Peter Woit (2007) put it, it is not even wrong. If we ignore such critics of the state of physics and accept the mainstream view we are told that nature can only be understood through mathematics which now cannot be interpreted in non-mathematical language [ … ]
The right hon. gentleman, who was doubtless aware of the popularity of the old English saying, "what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander," shrewdly judged that he could not go far wrong if he cut the Gordian knot in which the publican's disagreement was bound, by declaring his conviction that what was good for the Crown and Cushion, in the Strand, was likewise good for the Three Jolly Tinkers, in Brick Lane; and that, to put an end to the vexed question, the shortest way would be to tar them all with the same brush.

The growth of Big Science has been accompanied by changes in the sources of scientific patronage.
to crack on more sail, or more steam
Big science has replaced traditional science, which was little, and had little public concern. Today big science has new, exciting tasks. This should not be at the cost of a loss of little science. There is a need to revive and protect it, in order to insure the continued well-being of science as a whole. For this a new system is required, since the old one transformed into big science and is thus no longer adequate.

It is a redundancy of information processing as well as other efforts. Redundancy can take many forms. Most commonly, it is two or more people or organizations doing similar work for similar purposes and producing (it is hoped) similar (redundant) results. The Department of Redundancy Department exists because a great many people are doing a great many similar things with identical but separate data. If the use of data were controlled, these people and things would be known.

But, particularly in this Oversight Hearing on NSF, it is important to take note of essential characteristics of small science and of the benefit of such projects to the entire scientific enterprise. Small science projects are more apt to be scrutinized at every stage by peers, as they are conceived, designed, described, reviewed, conducted, assessed, and published. Small science helps more in producing the next generation of scientists; this becomes particularly critical as we seek to attract more women and minorities into science.
Making my tongue nice and stiff I entered her ass yet again, moving in and out as I ate her ass like a hungry and starved man. But it was not enough, for I longed for the sweetness of her, and so I moved my mouth and tongue further up to find her vertical smile. There I truly could taste her, enjoy her as I lovely^([sic]) licked at her privates again and again beckoning them to open up to me as I tried to French kiss her delicate lips.

Under the former system, the convicts of Philadelphia were obliged to perform labor in the public streets under degrading circumstances. These prisoners were called " the wheel-barrow men," and were often exposed to insult and ill-treatment by the mob.
Technology transfer and the principle of making useful research and development information available to all public sectors is now being endorsed by everybody.

When English judges speak of rights they often do so in terms that are usually imprecise and lacking in clear principle. The problem is worsened by the frequent judicial recourse to motherhood statements, which are not simply imprecise but provide generalised statements that are difficult to disagree with at a conceptual level. [ … ] [M]otherhood statements assume or imply the existence of what [Martin] Loughlin described as an 'imaginary consensus' on important doctrinal principles.

At worst, the term ‘ownership’ becomes a ‘motherhood statement’ which, whilst always sounding worthy, can be entirely lacking in specified content. The term ownership is used to imply varying degrees of local control that are typically not realized.
The deer family grouping is Cervidae, spelled without italics and pronounced SERV-ee-dah.
Just as an atom is a grouping of sub-atomic particles, and an organ or organism is a family grouping of cells, so also is 'the soul' a family grouping of selves.
One could say that at least Culpo's response referred to something specific in her life, and was not just the typical motherhood statement expected of polished beauty contestants – the proverbial Miss Universe answer.
The family grouping method allows the storer to handle products that have different storage characteristics.
The full power and utility of dimensional analysis is often underestimated and underutilized by engineers.
Dimensional analysis is a technique that can be used to clarify and explain relationships between physical quantities.
Aware of the too great proneness of his countrymen to ideas of despondency, knowing that ill news spreads apace, and that in an overgrown metropolis few have the opportunity of ocular demonstration of the state of the country's agriculture, this insidious letter has been written, that it might become the subject of conversation, and thus glide unawares into the ears of those who are inclined to view things on the gloomy side— If it only raise doubt, much of the writer's or his abettor's views are answered; but where it is received as fast, and thus propagated to others, every purpose he intended is fulfilled.
Buckingham investigated the foundation of Dimensional Analysis itself. In his paper, he stated, and proved, what became known as Buckingham's Pi theorem, which forms the foundation of Dimensional Analysis.

It is possible, however, to perceive what underpins modern German constitutional law on the basis of a second understanding of self-determination. … According to this understanding one is self-determining if one is a law unto oneself. Being a law unto oneself requires being true to oneself. The "self-given" law is the law on the ground of which the self is what it is.

A choice of particle statistics in quantum mechanics is equivalent to choosing representations Uₙ, of π₁(Mₙ), for all n, in the quantization procedure described in §1.2; see (1.3). Thus, for a system of point particles in d > 3 dimensional, physical space, particle statistics is described by the symmetry character of wave functions under permutations of particle positions.

So far as could be checked, only one king took a separate Seth name besides his Horus name. […] The Horus name of this king was Sekhemib and his Seth name was Peribsen.

But the big moose story here this year is that a number of white moose have been shot this season. My first thought was that it was an albino situation, but apparently not.

So long as women's sport is given such short shrift, especially in terms of media attention, commercial sponsorship and prize money, and so long as men fail to analyse the cultural connections between their ‘porn and prawn’ mornings, their conveyance of football violence from the field into their homes, and their desire for mateship against their homophobia, there is a place for feminism in football.

There has been an apparent increase in avocado related hand injuries. […] The mechanism of injury is usually a stabbing injury to the non-dominant hand as the knife slips past the stone, through the soft avocado fruit.

Rather, just as a cracker can be an open sourceror and vice versa, so many of the identities I am about to outline can be taken up by the same person at the same time, or be passed through over different times.
Negative lookahead works just like positive lookahead, except that whereas positive lookahead matches when the regex inside the lookahead matches, negative lookahead matches when the regex inside the lookahead failed to match.
And, even physically considered, knowledge breeds knowledge, as gold gold; for he who reads really much, finds his capacity to read increase in geometrical ratio. The helluo librorum will but glance at the page which detains the ordinary reader some minutes; and the difference in the absolute reading (its uses considered), will be in favor of the helluo, who will have winnowed the matter of which the tyro mumbled both the seeds and the chaff.
[I]f they each step off at the same instant, with the left foot, the sound of their feet will enable them to keep step and time, and march about in this form, as directed by the instructor, to the leading file, "right turn" or "left turn," without confusion.
From the bibliomaniac's "immense and curious library" to the "modern antiquary" with his "cabinet of never-to-be-described oddities" to the impossible science of bibliography to the cacoethes scribendi to the Helluo Librorum or "great devourer of books," whether in the college or the circulating library, the compulsion to pathologize book collection, authorship and reading had itself become endemic – a kind of "itch" whose compulsive reiteration suggested an ironic echo of the very afflictions these critics set themselves against ….
The incoming signals were broken down into digital code—ones and zeroes—by a relatively simple computer and downlinked to Fort Huachuca, where another computer of vastly greater power examined the bits of raw information and tried to make sense of them.

Group algebras are defined over the prime field Q or 𝔽_𝕡 (depending on the characteristic), and by what we have just proved Q G and 𝔽_𝕡G have splitting fields that are finite degree extensions of the prime field. [ … ] Some other basic facts about splitting fields are left to the exercises at the end of this chapter. Thus, if A is a finite-dimensional algebra over a field F that is a splitting field for A and E⊃F is a field extension, it is the case that every simple E⊗_FA-module can be written in F (Exercises 4 and 8).
The fact is that we have in this country today such inept people that they are not able to do what their grandmothers did; they cannot turn out a decent cake or a decent loaf of bread from wheat grown in this country. Their grandmothers were able to do that. What is wrong with those charged with manufacturing wheat into flour and flour into bread? Have they been so spoilt by alien trends and so trained in foreign habits and foreign manners that they have completely forgotten how to bake the old bastable cake and the loaf that was good enough a generation ago for the people of Cork city and the people of Dublin city?

You don't really think the Creams will maintain a tactful reserve? They'll dine out on it for years. Returning to America, they'll spread the story from the rock-bound coasts of Maine to the Everglades of Florida, with the result that when I go over there again, keen looks will be shot at me at every house I go into and spoons counted before I leave.”
He hadn't a pleasant time and was quite ill one day and couldn't eat anything – sodden bastable cake and smoky butter and tea was what he got in one house for breakfast and dinner.
Suppose you get in cheap made dishes from the pastrycook’s, and hire a couple of green-grocers, or carpet-beaters, to figure as footmen, dismissing honest MOLLY, who waits on common days, and bedizening your table (ordinarily ornamented with willow-pattern crockery) with twopenny-halfpenny Birmingham plate.

Foliar fungicides are not economical for controlling brown leaf spot on most commercial long grain varieties.
The potential of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), when applied alone or in combination with fungicides or antibiotics was assessed for the control of coffee rust (Hemileia vastatrix) and brown leaf spot (Phoma costarricencis) under field conditions and also for the control of brown eye spot (Cercospora cofffeicola) and bacerial blight (Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae) on coffee seedlings.
Without a real market to determine the price such suggested prices should be discounted with extreme prejudice by any potential investors.
The centerpiece of the court's justification for reversing and remanding was its conclusion that when the trial judge disclosed the terms of the settlement, he created a great risk of extreme prejudice to the remaining defendant.

Old Rip Van Winkle's long sleep record, which, according to [Washington] Irving’s story of the famous legendary character of the Hudson Valley, was 20 years, is excelled by each of us who lives to a fairly ripe old age. Thus truth is again stranger than fiction, says Dr. Donald A. Laird, of Colgate university, for by the time we are 60 years old we have spent 20 years or one-third of our lives in the arms of Morpheus.
He looked over his shoulder and saw that Susan was still safely in the arms of Morpheus as the bedclothes gently rose and fell.
In spite of their efforts to avoid it, members of the "Wood Family" were constantly in evidence. In the slang of the circus, the phrase simply meant empty seats.

But although AFI (The Blood Album) doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it doesn’t need to: The record illustrates that the members of AFI are deeply committed to forward motion, and remain as fired up now as they were 25 years ago.
It would seem as if the touch of a democratic and anarchical independence had paralysed improvement, which was, in all conscience, slow enough, even in the viceregal times.
God has nowhere been left without witness, and, in ways beyond our knowing, women and men who have never heard the Christian gospel, or having heard it, have, in all conscience, declined to accept it have known God's “uncovenanted mercies” and, by reason of what Anglican theologians often refer to as the ministry of the “unincarnate Logos,” have come to be of the truth that Jesus is.

Historically, deciding whether to use the V or T form was determined by the power relationship between the interlocutors. Lower status persons addressed higher status persons with the V form; conversely higher status persons addressed lower status with the T form.
In most Romance languages, the “intimate” T form is believed to be semantically more basic than the “formal” V form (Wierzbicka 1992:320).

The secular arm as a means by which lay power intervenes in ecclesiastical cases had two types: sought and unsought by the Church.
We also understand that when the secular arm has the power it is requirable by the Church to execute those who entertain views opposed to the Papacy; and that the only reason why the Church does not now require it is that the secular arm is not at the Pope's command.

For Mexican Americans, the reverse one-drop rule operated to open up white status to Mexicans, and thereby the assumption of some political rights, but it also operated to impose a contingent whiteness.

The principal concern of those who are interested in the texts of this period is the varying, and with time increasing, extent of the deviation of their language from Traditional Egyptian.
For more than a millennium, Traditional Egyptian coexisted with the various stages of Later Egyptian (see below) in a situation of diglossia, maintaining the linguistic structures of the classical language, but displaying, especially in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, an expansion of its graphic inventory.

No one can keep working twenty-four hours a day. I can't emphasize enough how important the support of family members is to making single parenting work.
She takes it in her mouth almost reflexively. She sucks and jerks simultaneously. There's no way I can hold back. Ninety seconds of this and I've exploded all up in her throat. She swallows. Like a champion. Spitters are quitters.
Foot passengers, jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke (if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.

And, Dag, have you ever noticed that your bungalow looks more like it belongs to a pair of Eisenhower era Allentown, Pennsylvania newlyweds than it does to a fin de siècle existentialist poseur?
It is the privilege of every pilot to think of himself, privately at least, as a hot rock of the first magnitude. Whether he is or not is an evaluation that he is not altogether qualified to make for himself.
It was that “pinch,” or conflict, between such feelings and the pilot’s Call for authenticity that led me to write down in my own notebook, "emotional labor."
"Wife, I've a grave suspicion!" said Mahony, and took her by the chin. "While I've sat here with my head in the clouds, you've been worrying over ways and means, and over having such an unpractical old dreamer for a husband. Now, child, that won't do. I didn't marry to have my girl puzzling her little brains where her next day's dinner was to come from. Away with you, to your stitching! Things will be all right, trust to me."

Hey! Go easy on him!
No one ever expected him to work; he would see his little sister stooping under the weight of the great milk-pails, and never think of helping her; he lived with his head in the clouds, but his father said, "Let him alone, he'll be a great man some day."
Who then, I say, will excuse these mass-gospellers' consciences? Will the Queen's highness? She shall then have more to do for herself than, without hearty and speedy repentance, she can ever be able to answer, though Peter, Paul, Mary, James, John, the Pope and all his prelates, take her part, with all the singing "Sir Johns" that ever were, are, and shall be.
Being as you're so clever, why don't you fix it yourself?
I do not believe they wanted the money, but they wanted to do some melon cutting for the benefit of their shareholders.

Very few patients for whom I provided psychiatric treatment ended their lives by suicide, but I became increasingly convinced that my residency instructor who touched wood because none of his patients had killed themselves had not been treating many seriously mentally ill patients for any extended period of time.

It is a political offering – the Eurovision palaver, where Madonna hamfistedly tried to engineer peace in the Middle East, was a foreshadowing – but one in which Madonna’s meanings often perform a kind of seven-veil dance.
Orion hit a rabbit once; but though sore wounded it got to the bury, and, struggling in, the arrow caught the side of the hole and was drawn out. Indeed, a nail filed sharp is not of much avail as an arrowhead; you must have it barbed, and that was a little beyond our skill.

Hi, Amelia! Are you busy? — I’m a little busy. Audio (US) (file)
In his book Metamorphoses of Science Fiction (1979), Suvin introduced a number of ideas that remain central in sf criticism: cognitive estrangement, the novum and sf's genetic link with utopia. In the notion of cognitive estrangement, Suvin conflate two distict, but related, ideas of estrangement from earlier literary theory: ostranenie (de-familiarization) from the Russian Formalists, and Berthold Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt (alienation effect). [ … ] Even more influential in sf theory than cognitive estrangement is Suvin's concept of the novum.
Darko Suvin, the eminent theorist of science fiction, defined science fiction as a literature of cognitive estrangement, a genre in which the reader enters an imaginative world different or estranged from his or her empirical world, but different in a way that obeys rational causation or scientific law: thus, it is estranged cognitively.

After the deadly shooting attack at Barnoar, liberal homophobia surfaced along with support for the community. It took the form of a debate over coming out of the closet and "outing". Many people said that a person's sexual orientation was his own private business, and spoke out against the expectation that well-known people would come out of the closet. The debate ignored the fact that society considers only one sexual orientation a private matter. Heterosexuality is always public, and may always be talked about.
Another type of men’s group, or trend in critical thought on men, is often forgotten in our typologies: the “gay groups” along with their commercial and association networks. Their omission highlights the heterocentrism on the part of men studies, which can only deconstruct masculinity in its heterosexual expression. A common current form of liberal homophobia is demonstrated in accepting this sphere, even mentioning the GLBT movement, but eventually not granting gays the status of men that would enable us to include them in our deconstruction of hegemonic masculinity.

Most studies indicate that Black family members live in proximity, in part an outcome of segregated communities. These close-knit communities helped to produce strong fictive kin relations with neighbors and fellow church members, which in turn provided support in the face of discrimination from the larger society.
In Little Old New York, there is a political pep rally at the front steps of the Bank of New York.
The 2004 pep rally, a company activity where employees are entertained and encouraged to do more for the company, featured a company fashion show.
In the socialist era [ … ] [t]he custom of making fictive kin became less popular or went underground. Since the late 1970s, however, the custom has revived in Nanying. While many features of fictive kin relationships remain the same, the motive for establishing the relationship has changed. Most commonly, people attempt to improve household status through the establishment of fictive kin links.
Figure 4-6 A shows a tree that barber chaired when the back cut was too low. Figure 4-6 B shows why it's called a “barber chair”.
Attaining fictive kin status requires that a person have prolonged physical proximity to a family member in order to develop a relationship that is both interdependent and mutually beneficial. Persons generally obtain fictive kin status by consistently contributing to the emotional or material needs of an individual over time.

Many believe that this country should set the other nations of the world a great moral example by pulling the teeth of our dogs of war, making them lambs, and inviting the lions to lie down with them, unheedful of the lesson of all ages that when the lion does lie down with the lamb, the lamb is always inside the lion.

At one time, when the commandant felt especially indebted, he sent the other officers out of his office and opened the safe. There it was, securely hidden, an entire loaf of white bread.

The common people, however, seem to have been more tolerant of the Molly houses in their midst.
Maybe he was murdered the first night he ran away or maybe he was kidnapped and sold to a Mollie house where men dressed as women.

It's also possible that this Dennis is based on the real-life Labour firebrand, Denis Healey (b. 1917), the shadow of Chancellor of the Exchequer 1972-1974.

Enjoying such popularity his appointment may be confirmed by the king of Siam, and not otherwise.

He had learned that the great disturbance amongst a portion of the guards was attributed to the failure in issuing a certain rate of allowance which was called riot money.

I did fulfill another dream, however, one that began when I first looked down on the Takla Makan Desert from atop a 17,000-foot mountain in Russian Turkestan. I dreamed of traveling through Central Asia and finding people not yet influenced by our civilization., It may seem strange that someone in love with boats and the sea should love the deserts of Central Asia.

The illimitable expanses of both, stretching away to the horizon on all sides, can inspire exhilarating feelings of freedom, of being master of your own fate. Both the desert and the sea can also be pitiless to the lazy, the unprepared, the unwary traveler who ventures upon them. He may pay with his life for his shortcomings.

Central among the institutions she must encounter in her life is that of the sexual marketplace, where human beings are viewed as having a price, and not a dignity, and where the price of women is fixed in a particular way. Women, as things, as items in the sexual marketplace, have a market value that depends in part on whether they have been used. Virgins fetch a higher price than second hand goods.

Localization makes use of a process known as postponement, which refers to the method by which the commitment of a product to its final form or destination is delayed. When decisions on the final product configuration are made ahead of market demand, there is the risk that the products that are in finished goods are not what the customer demands. The philosophy of postponement ideally begins on the drawing board when the products are designed with late configuration in mind.

While the deterrent of by-elections has forced Morrison's lower house ministers to retire ahead of an all-but-certain return to opposition, those in the Senate can take a wait-and-see approach.

Reluctantly, Armstrong began spending more and more “time in the barrel,” as the astronauts called the frequent public appearances that were considered an important part of the job, because it was believed by NASA brass the only way to keep Congress passing billion-dollar budgets was to keep the public firmly in their corner.

The auricular style was created by two members of the Utrecht goldsmithing family of van Vianen.
The subtlety and refinement of the auricular style as practised by the Van Vianens plainly appealed very considerably to Charles [I, King of England], not least because they were so different from the humdrum or conservative Late Mannerist style of English goldsmith's work. For if Christian [van Vianen] was not an innovator, yet he was at his best a most excellent workman in the auricular style.

Mystical and scholarly interest in the mystery religions, especially the Eleusinian mysteries of Ceres-Isis which were celebrated annually in August, was strong from the Renaissance on, its strength deriving in part from the emotional call of the feminine on the one hand and tantalising lack of evidence as to what actually went on at the celebration of the mysteries on the other.

This process of vertical and horizontal integration has resulted in consolidation of control over basic transformation technologies used in the genetic modification of crops; control over proprietary traits; and control over the elite germplasm resources for many of the world's most important commercial crops.
There is a reference in the Birmingham Daily Gazette to a 'hooligan outrage' in Newton Row in January 1907 - which had formerly been a peaky blinder stronghold - when three men of the peaky blinder type savagely attacked and robbed a businessman late at night, but there appears to be no mention of assaults or fights by peaky blinders after that..
The prevailing wisdom today is that any benefits of vertical integration tend to be outweighed by the greater advantages of specializing in a narrow range of vertical activities.

Escorted by the local soldiery we moved slowly in procession into Yangi Hissar. It was a relief to enter the cool, dustless streets of the bazaars, which here are not domed as in Persia but roofed after a fashion with sacking and wattles. The shops struck us as neater and cleaner than those of India or Persia, the counters of the many food-shops, fruiterers, butchers, etc., being well scrubbed. The Chinese shops are particularly neat and tidy, and reminded one of village " general shops " at home.

However, as with the environmentalism movement and the phenomenon of greenwashing, we are increasingly witnessing something that has been referred to as "open washing" (Openwashing, n.d.) or sometimes "faux-pen" (Searls, 2009).

Even a highly skilled player with thousands of hours in online multiplayer matches will have a kill-to-death ratio hovering around 2.00 and will have witnessed several thousand deaths of his avatar.

Now that the length of tangent vector is defined, the magnitude of a differential form is also determined. By making use of this fact we can give a more precise statement to the theorem of de Rham. That is, from the point of view of magnitude, we may prove that within the set of all closed forms representing a de Rham cohomology class, there is one and only one differential form that has the best shape. Such a form is called a harmonic form, and it can be characterized by using a differential operator called the Laplacian.

We now discuss what appears at first glance to be an unrelated topic, namely that of additive combinatorics (and its noncommutative counterpart, multiplicative combinatorics). One of the main objects of study in either additive or multiplicative combinatorics are approximate groups — sets A (typically finite) contained in an additive or multiplicative ambient group G that are "almost groups" in the sense that they are "almost" closed under either addition or multiplication.

Telluride held union Thanksgiving services, Montrose had the traditional Christmas program (an innovation was Mistress Santa Claus), Durango held revivals, and Pagosa Springs fought a bitter campaign against “demon rum.”
Bracket creep can be avoided by regularly adjusting tax brackets for inflation, so that the tax brackets remain unchanged in real terms.

One of the better jokes arrives late into the movie, when Guy is forced to take on a brawny he-man doppelgänger—a planned addition to the game’s sequel—who the programmers haven’t finished scripting, and his unfinished dialogue is all placeholders.

Minneapolis is banishing the “beg button” at hundreds of city intersections, automating the walk signs so pedestrians don’t have to touch a potentially germ-ridden surface.
A HAPPY REUNION, The Chinese crested tern, a sizeable seabird, had not been seen since 1937. In June 2000, eight adults with some young birds were sighted on the Taiwanese island of Mazu, off the Chinese coast of Fu Jian province.

But the story is not all guns and roses. Many of these foreign fighters die in the combat zone or end up moving on to fight in other foreign conflicts. Significant percentages simply cannot endure the training or become disillusioned once they come to realize that the harsh realities of waging a bloody jihad are far less glamorous than they seemed from afar.

He started shipping about half a case of fresh country eggs to my parents every week or two.

The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars cheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, 'To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea,' where—

It has often been written that pirates commonly killed their prisoners, usually by the picturesque method of making them ‘walk the plank.’ This is untrue. I have ransacked official records, reports of trials, and much other documentary evidence without being able to discover a single case of walking the plank. I do not mean merely that I have not found an authenticated case. In all the contemporary literature on pirates I could not find even an accusation or suggestion that the practice was ever used. The very expression seems to have been invented many years after the Age of Piracy.
[Stephen] Sondheim and [Arthur] Laurents didn't give up. They decided that Fay's opening speech and song [in the musical Anyone Can Whistle] were overkill and one had to go. In a move one wouldn't expect in a musical, "There Won't Be Trumpets" walked the plank while the speech stayed.

A boat was then dispatched to sound the channel, and attempt and entrance ; but returned without success, there being a tremendous swell, and breakers. Signal-guns were fired again in the evening, but equally in vain, and once more the ship stood off to sea for the night.
The moral sense of the world would have been shocked at the spectacle of a vulgar commonplace ruffian who, in a public railway saloon, publicly shot the chief magistrate of the United States, in the presence of a Cabinet minister and a number of spectators.

In 1952, the Catholic churches, Latter-Day Saints (LDS) churches, and Jewish synagogues reported only adherent data (which included prescribed persons and persons of all ages); in 1981, the Catholic and LDS churches again provided only adherent data.

With Æschylus the popular divinities, like upstart creations of a later creed, are mere Di ex machinis, obedient to the all-powerful will of Destiny, which he ever contrives to keep in view, and make us sensible of.
One thing certainly vexes me, the cool way these governing men with their positions above the working conflict come down as di ex machinis, quite unconscious of the intense interest these frog pattings have for the frogs and of their own ignorance of frog life I see how impossible it is for a Government like ours to promote good except by stopping evil.

She tossed her head. “He's nosy parkering.”
Odin might himself have saved his favourite, and he might have slain Svipdag’s son Asmund with his spear Gunguer; but he does not do so; instead, he brings Vagnhofde to protect him. This is well calculated from an epic standpoint, while dii ex machina, when they appear in person on the battle-field with their superhuman strength, diminish the effect of the deeds of mortal heroes, and deprive every distress in which they have taken part of its most earnest significance. Homer never violated this rule without injury to the honour either of his gods or of his heroes.

Since the press, commanding the service of every other means of communication, is the common carrier of information, delivering it almost instantly and simultaneously through out a nation, and there is no other carrier a thousandth part so efficient any restriction upon the information it may convey deprives every citizen in some degree of capacity for intelligent thought and wise action. This is obviously of great importance in relation to the affairs of government and that is why since its vital connection with the welfare of peoples has been understood, the freedom of the press has been so jealously guarded no more by its own servants than by the statesman, the publicist, and the enlightened citizen.

During the 1950s, all of the remaining Aboriginal traditional owners were removed to a government settlement on nearby Croker Island. In 1981, the establishment of Gurig National Park was agreed to by the Northern Territory government and the Aboriginal traditional owners in order to resolve a pending land claim under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northrn Territory. Rather than proceed with the claim, the traditional owners consented to the establishment of the national park in return to^([sic]) regaining title to their native lands.
The decision of one senior traditional owner to stand outside the negotiation process militated against an even more favourable outcome.

A team of researchers from Norway, Germany, and Italy, for example, has recently pinpointed the particular populations of modern wild einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum subsp. boeoticum) that best fit the profile of those stands that probably gave rise about 10,000 years ago in the Near East to domesticated einkorn (Heun et al., 1997).
Nevertheless, since some plants and animals were more amenable to domestication and more useful (the “founder crops” of emmer and einkorn wheat, barley, lentil, pea, chickpea, bitter vetch (Zohary and Hopf 2000); and sheep, goats, and pigs), its origin and spread within that region can be traced.
I think basing your actions off an assumption like that is a slippery slope that is going to get you in trouble.
Wheat refers to genus Triticum, of which a great number of species are cultivated. Einkorn wheat is one of them and refers to the genus^([sic, meaning species]) Triticum monococcum. It is one of the earliest cultivated forms of wheat and its husks enclose the grains tightly. The husking process of Einkorn wheat is shown in Figure 2.1.

Summers believes that quantitative easing (printing a lot more yen and getting them circulated) is the most effective way of doing that.
In times of severe economic distress, however, rates may fall to zero. Cue QE. When the Bank of Japan (BoJ) pioneered QE in 2001, its goal was to buy enough securities to create a desired quantity of reserves (hence, “quantitative easing”). Its actions, it hoped, would raise asset prices and end deflation.

Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits — of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.

Carroll turned away to lead Liverpool's insistent protests that the ball had crossed the line but referee Phil Dowd and assistant referee Andrew Garratt waved play on, with even a succession of replays proving inconclusive.

My biggest regret is that such a broad and eclectic approach, while in important respects appropriate for a foray into only partly charted territory, inevitably means that I treat some fascinating literatures in a smash and grab manner—I do not do justice to their intrinsic complexity or subtlety.
His career has been interpreted over the last century or more as being symptomatic of a wide range of forces thought to be at work in al-Andalus in his day, ranging from sheer smash and grab brigandage to incipient Hispanic nationalism, and from the alienation of indigenous neo-Muslims to a last gasp resistance on the part of a dwindling Christian minority trying to preserve their culture from total extinction.

Estimates of coal which can be strip mined should not be interpreted to mean that this coal can only be strip mined. Strip mining began as a process of recovering coal which was located quite near the surface of the earth or at the "outcrop" on a hillside.

Because of its low sulfur content, Western coal is generally preferred over Eastern coal for environmental reasons. As a result, Western coal is being strip mined at unprecedented rates.

A relatively novel legal issue was raised by dissenters who contended that they did not so much oppose war in general as the Viet Nam war in particular. This contention, which became known as the Nuremberg defense, was raised by some young men who did not qualify as conscientious objectors and who were prosecuted for refusing to submit to induction.

https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2965&context=hastings_law_journal#page=413 pages 413–434 The modern Nuremberg Defenses are the antithesis of the original defense: criminal defendants today build a defense based on the reasoning and principles used by the Allied nations to convict Germans at Nuremberg. There are essentially two modern Nuremberg Defenses: the Citizen's Duty and the Citizen's Privilege. … Under the Citizen's Duty defense, defendants assert that they could be held liable for complicity with international crimes if they fail to take action to prevent such crimes. … https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2965&context=hastings_law_journal page 416 Under the Citizen's Privilege formulation of the Defense, the Nuremberg Principles are joined with the statutory and common law privileges allowing citizens to prevent crime.

In United States v. Berrigan, a Federal court in Maryland laid down a legal blueprint for the treatment of war protest cases where an attempt was made to invoke the "Nuremberg defence." Father Philip Berrigan and three others stood charged with injuring the property of the United States Government, mutilating records filed in a public office of the United States, and hindering the administration of the Military Selective Service Act.
An area in which one may indeed use the international defence, like the Nuremberg defence, though with little success, is opposition to nuclear weapons and other situations where civil disobedients set themselves against military combat. [ … ] Therefore, civil disobedients' interference in the production of weapons is not criminally culpable, but rather clearly excusable as avoiding the violation of a more serious law. Although this defence has had little success so far, it is worth brandishing and counts amongst the defences preferred by civil disobedients.

In attempting to make the ‘Divina Commedia’ better known to English readers, it might have been held only a fitting mark of deference to my original to reproduce it, if practicable, in the metre of the poet's own choice. But on the appearance of my ‘Inferno,’ its Terza Rima was denounced as the one ‘deleterious ingredient’ which corrupted the version throughout, [ … ]

This wonderful midnight sun has a peculiar effect on the polar vegetation. Although the foliage of ligneous plants, such as shrubs and trees, which here sink down to the condition of dwarfs, is tough and coriaceous, and of a dark and sombre green, gloomy as the long night of the polar world, yet in the steady light which comes from the sun as he circulates above the horizon for weeks, that sombre green tint of the foliage is beautifully softened in the grasses and other herbaceous plants.
The summer snow capping the jagged summits was bathed in a soft sky-blue pink from the lowering sun. Fauchard filled his red-rimmed eyes with the magnificent beauty, as he cocked his ear and listened to the exhaust sound produced by the eighty-horsepower, four-stroke Gnome rotary engine that powered the Morane-Saulnier N aircraft. All was well.
But when we come to the winter solstice, we get no more midnight suns: as shown in the figure, all the circle is situated in the shaded portion; hence, again in spite of the Earth's rotation, we cannot get out of the darkness, and we do not see the Sun even at noonday.
Sam came out carrying a plastic bag of trash. He scanned the sky. “Guess what? Your favorite color is about to appear.” “What color?” Maddie glanced up. The sun was sliding behind the woods. He sat down beside her. “Sky-blue pink, what else?” Maddie pursed her lips. “That color is not on any of my chalks or crayons. Or these paint papers. It's not real.” “This color is better than any color you've ever seen. I promise. Just watch.” Puffy sheep clouds floated across the blue-sky field.
What these figures show you is how badly the Tory dream has crashed and burned. Not only do fewer Britons now own shares than they did in Thatcher’s time, but also in the capital owner-occupiers (both with mortgages and without) will soon be an outright minority.
Like the seasons, the "Midnight Sun" has its origin in the inclination of the earth's axis during its annual motion. [ … ] The effect of this inclination is to produce variations in the length of the day to such an extent, that in polar regions the duration of sunlight is reckoned in months instead of hours.
They cling high in the branches and drop at the first sign of life below. You're walking along and thump, there's a drop bear covering your head. Their claws are so long they usually need surgical removal. It's quite a business, carting drop bear victims to hospital with drop bear attached.

There are strange things done in the midnight sun / By the men who moil for gold; / The Arctic trails have their secret tales / That would make your blood run cold; / The Northern Lights have seen queer sights, / But the queerest they ever did see / Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge / I cremated Sam McGee.

The powerful and the fortunate are very fond of the maxim, "where there's a will there's a way;" and they rarely use it without expressing in very clear terms a cold, insolent, and uncharitable judgment upon exertions they are themselves not called upon to make, while they modestly declare that such exertions, if by them made, would be triumphant.

“Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have recently received attention owing to their widespread contamination in the environment. One of major manufacturers, 3M Company voluntarily phased out PFOS production in 2002,” scientists in Yoshida, Japan report.
Even now, one pays attention to the complex-indicators which we have studied, especially the physical ones (blushings, twitchings, strikingly soft or loud, quick or slow speech, smiling upon the recounting of severe suffering ("La belle indifference"), symptomatic movements, etc).
It is interesting to note that insofar as this supports our hypothesis it accords with the time-worn conception of the hysterical patient with little or no anxiety — la belle indifference.
The barrage of machine-gun fire turned back the encroaching soldiers.
Curious, I looked it up and discovered that it's in the class of chemicals that were manufactured by 3M for use in Scotchguard, among other consumer products and applications. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) received a flurry of attention around 2000, when studies of its effects on animal and human health showed that it was bioaccumulative (meaning that it accumulates in body tissue, especially in fat where it can linger for years), persistent, and toxic to mammals.

Most of us have heard of la belle indifférence of the French neurologists. This term attempts to convey the beautiful calm of those hysterics who have achieved their ambition to avoid responsibility by inducing in themselves a state of resistless torpor and the reputation for chronic invalidism bravely borne.

I have never really found Homer [Simpson] to be a jerk ass because well frankly, it never occurred to me before hearing about it on the internet.
In Polish Notation, the connectives are placed before the wffs. The virtue of this sentence is that its grammar is simpler, for it has no need for parentheses. Sider’s examples: (P ∧ Q) → R and P ∧ (Q → R) become → ∧PQR and ∧P → QR., If you actually look at a text in this tradition, you’ll find something slightly different. “C” stands for “consequence”, i.e., implication (→) and “N” for negation (∼)., So,consider the following from Tarski and Łukasiewicz’s Investigations into the Sentential Calculus.

Once control of the media was wrested from Mao's most strident defenders, the abusive language Chiang Ch'ing had used against her enemies over the years was hurled back at her. The verbal weapons borrowed from Lu Hsun backfired. "Ruthlessly beat the dog in the water," her enemies repeated as they vowed to fight the Gang of Four to the finish. Their claims to have been the standard-bearers of the much-exploited Lu Hsun were mocked.
Chinese and Japanese scholars attending a symposium on the problems facing the Peiping regime Dec. 17 reached the conclusion that the trial of the "gang of four" and six other defendants in Peiping is actually a trial of Mao Tse-tung and his thought.

Having regard to this dictum it is clear to me that the plaintiff cannot rely on negotiorum gestorum to recover damages. The gestor, ie the plaintiff, did not intend to serve the dominus, ie the defendants. The gestor did not act bona fide in the mistaken belief that he was serving the dominus. It was the plaintiff's evidence that in an attempt to preserve its good name and reputation it was decided to accept the cancellation of the agreement. It is thus clear that the gestor, the plaintiff acted mala fide in its own interest. In my view, the plaintiff cannot succeed on this principle of negotiorum gestorum.

Boatsheds and bathing boxes were strung along the beaches of Port Phillip Bay for the shelter of boats as well as the bodies of the affluent.
You seem to think you're a bit of a Jack the lad, don't you?
His father had a franchise from the Burnaby estate that allowed only him to put bathing boxes on the south beach for which he paid a rent of perhaps a shilling per box.
It appeared as though someone in the Battalion must have killed a Chinaman, as the weather continued rough and stormy, with strong wind.
Beach huts, owned or leased, are not habitable but can be used as a shelter and changing room on the beach.
Installed in a stark London gallery, Emin's work symbolized the beach hut as icon of the seaside.
Yet the statue is drawn from one of the most famous of all Australian images: the photograph from World War II of a blind, wounded soldier being guided down a jungle track by a Papuan carrier, a ‘fuzzy wuzzy angel’.
But you'll have to wait in line in the morning to reserve a beach hut, and one never gets used to the sad sight of parrots, toucans, and cockatoos squawking in their cages.
I want to commend the motion passed this week because it calls for the immediate determination of a new award and medal to be presented to the fuzzy wuzzy angels, who carried stretchers, stores and wounded diggers directly on their shoulders over some of the toughest terrain in the world.
"By all means we want people to use social media, but we do not want you to use it in ways that will incite violence," said Jonathan Toy, Southwark council's head of community safety. "This remains a big issue for us and without some form of censorship purely focusing on [violent videos], I'm not sure how we can address it."
I grow weary when I think of this as the new normal for what is considered to be a fruitful personal life. Social media is no longer a mere public extension of our private socialization; it has become a replacement for it.
Chances are the person to whom you′re speaking is the descendant of an indigenous veteran or Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel.
I have given you examples of some of the reforms we have already put in place which are helping young people, for example, to find jobs instead of getting sit-down money, which they got from Labor.

It isn't bad when we come back; we notice little similarities to our dreaming places. The cabbage palms, the fire pit, the family.
A discussion paper being released today canvasses a number of proposals to transform the payments that have become known as ‘sit-down money’.
So far be it from wanting sit-down money. More and more Indigenous leaders are telling me that that is what has destroyed their society.
Meanwhile everyone else in your family is unemployed, getting $400 a fortnight unemployment benefit (which the Warlpiri describe as ‘sit-down money’). As soon as your $600 is in your hand, there are eight people who you are obliged to distribute it to, in the same way that you would have to distribute a kangaroo. When they get paid, they also have to share their sit-down money with each of the others.

Etorphine, a morphine analog, is a powerful stimulant known as "elephant juice" because it is used to tranquilize large circus animals. Given in small dosage, it acts as a stimulant. "It ranges up to 10,000 times more powerful than morphine," the New York Daily News quoted one expert as saying. "If there is one drug that does not belong in the body of the thoroughbred it is etorphine. Even a slight overdose could kill a horse."

1953/6: Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, You Ain't Nothing But A Hound Dog (song made famous by Elvis Presley with these revised words in 1956) - You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog, Cryin’ all the time. Well, you ain’t never caught a rabbit And you ain’t no friend of mine.
After hurling their insults, they ran like the clappers to get away.
I look sexier in high heels.
We've gone through regional and rural Australia like the clappers, and everywhere we went, irate voters shouted at us and we stuck our heads out the windows and shouted: "What?" and the electorate respected us for it.
In fact she made quite a nice little rider — a bit rough, like these Australians always were, but quite secure in her seat and going like the clappers.
In that year all the sons of Juchi except Tuka Timur went to assist at the inauguration of Ogotai Khan, and he was left behind in charge of the Golden Horde.
Now these bodies hanging from that overhead pipe. The cocked heads. The dangling shoes. The tongues protruding like summer sausages.
As the last Khan of the Golden Horde watched in senile befuddlement, the great silver bird issued a terrible battlecry and began to move.

Summer melt sometimes happens when students are admitted over the summer to a school that places the student on a waitlist in the spring.
I was informed that, sometime since, a young man—I think his name was John Hooke, Brazilian consul—had retired thither, in hopes of avoiding the baleful influence of disease; but, alas! how futile are all human hopes and purposes—he, too, became a victim, and now lies in the white man's grave.
(a) Meat pie is cooked meat with or without cereal, condiments seasoning and water, enclosed in a case of pastry. (b) Meat pie shall contain not less than twenty-five parts per centum of meat when determined by the prescribed method.
The significance of Y-bar steel is that it is used to produce star picket posts by cutting the steel into fence post lengths and drilling holes through which wire will pass. Star picket fencing is the most popular form of rural fencing used in Australia.
In this case, BHP was the sole domestic manufacturer of a steel fence post known as a star picket, which it produced from an intermediate steel product called a Y bar. [ … ] QWI sought supplies of Y bar from BHP in order to manufacture its own star picket fence posts and thereby be in a position to deliver a full range of products to large consumers at competitive prices.
Meat pies are an Australian favourite and are sold in cake and sandwich shops from one end of the land to the other. The classic version is simple – an individual, 2-crust pie full of chopped beef in a rich gravy.
Then I levelled the sand and lightly packed soil with the rake and shovel and put in a star picket to indicate where it was.
If you think the major ingredient in most meat pies is meat you’re in for a disappointment. But some brands are meatier than others.

Social psychologist Leon Festinger first proposed the theory in 1957 after the publication of his book When Prophecy Fails, observing the counterintuitive belief persistence of members of a UFO doomsday cult and their increased proselytization after the leader's prophecy failed. The failed message of earth's destruction, purportedly sent by aliens to a woman in 1956, became a disconfirmed expectancy that increased dissonance between cognitions, thereby causing most members of the impromptu cult to lessen the dissonance by accepting a new prophecy: that the aliens had instead spared the planet for their sake.
I was spot on with my guess.

I had to repeat the instructions for her five times; methinks the old lady was aurally challenged.
The script itself contains variable and command substitution, the read command, and a while loop to get everything done in less than 10 lines of executable code!
I'd stationed Ashley and Willow at the pizza table, where they were handing out slices to anyone who volunteered to sign our Peace Pledge.

‘What’s in it for the woman?’ asks Lisa when they’re discussing donkey punches earlier in the evening. ‘I don’t understand the question’, replies Bluey. It’s the film’s only funny moment.
You know, he wasn’t wrong. Or did he lose out because Donkey Punches involve hitting a participant in the back of their heads, not their necks?
And then, without missing a beat on his pussy-pumpin' action, he donkey punches her with the pot, shattering it and embedding shards of glass in her scalp.
grimmy fucks her doggystyle like no tomorrow, and right before she's about to come, he donkey punches her!
He's going for the brass ring.
Put succinctly, the question is this: How does a generation with absolute knowledge of felching, donkey punching, and the dirty sanchez maintain healthy sex lives?
The release of the new film Donkey Punch, a saga about English holidaymakers on a Mediterranean holiday who get involved in a life or death struggle aboard a yacht, will probably not trouble either Bafta or the Academy Awards committee unduly. It is culturally notable, however, for its title. It is, in fact, a rather rude title, is Donkey Punch. Put it this way, no donkey comes to any physical harm in the act of donkey punching, though, arguably, an ass might well. Kids, be warned.
Another Kennedy Reaches for the Brass Ring [title] The latest entry in the political Irish sweepstakes is Teddy Kennedy, the President's 30-year-old brother.
Clark asked Shaw, "Have you ever been donkey punched?" The comment made her uncomfortable because of the accompanying gesture he used and the way he said it. She did not know what he meant at that time and assumed he was referring to a violent act. Shortly thereafter, however, she asked her sister Tara about the term. Tara told her the phrase had a sexual connotation and referred to a sexual position. In a declaration, filed in opposition to the summary adjudication motion, Shaw stated that within a few days of Clark's comment, Tara explained to her that "donkey punched" described an act of anal sex by tackle or force, involving violence.
I'm holdin' on / I can't fall back / Now that big brass ring / Is a shade of black
Bear in mind, however, that for some purchasing people, deciding to use an agent is a little like turkeys voting for Christmas.
The anti-divorce rallying cry of Fine Gael′s Alice Glenn, ‘Women voting for divorce is like turkeys voting for Christmas’, captured the sense of fear felt by many at the economic consequences of divorce for women.
As a perversion of freedom it was, like any perversion, erotic; as alienation it carried the frisson of having just missed the brass ring, a sensation that always brought one back for more.
This seems not to exhaust what is called dirty work, regardless of the synonym used (scut work, shit work) by workers themselves — either those actually engaged in the work or others who are lucky enough to escape it.

When even the silence and seclusion of this retreat failed to bring slumber, he sometimes called in a professional mesmerizer to put him into a hypnotic sleep, from which Sawyer knew how to arouse him at a fixed time. This habit, as well as the existence of the underground chamber, were secrets known only to Sawyer and the hypnotist who rendered his services. On the night of May 30, 1887, West sent for the latter, and was put to sleep as usual.

In intermitting fevers of an obſtinate nature, I have found it necessary to throw in the bark much faſter.
This is in accord with facts, for I can by cold put to sleep special parts of the nervous mass without putting other parts to sleep.

Art-making may have emerged as early as 1.5 million years ago with the arrival of Homo erectus, our humanlike ancestors. … Cave painting and early sketching were ways to enhance thinking, serving as a medium for idea manipulation, enhancement, and storage.
[I]f I, in the performance of my work, have been second to none, do you see that you in yours may be equally efficient?
Prehistoric pottery, art, cave painting, engraving can be incorporated into the exhibition as an added colourful attraction.
Although somewhat difficult to date, the earliest direct evidence of human interest in honey occurs in the famous stone-age cave painting from southern Spain, of a man robbing a wild bees' nest.
The NanShan, he affirmed, was second to none as a sea-boat.
The well-known Neolithic cave painting from Morella la Villa in Spain unmistakably shows a battle between two small groups of archers.

"Pretty much the same old-same old," she lied with an idle shrug. "The faces change every night, but the party never ends."
Many people and systems do not fully realize the seismic shift underway, a historic employment crisis, a K-wave in the United States of America and especially around the world, the new world order, yet same old-same old, until it affects them, by which time it is often too late, and there is not enough time to adjust before the sudden impact.

People were angry about the postcode lottery in the NHS [National Health Service], or that this school is better than that school and I can't get into the good school. Of all inequalities, these things make people far angrier than anything else, even angrier than financial inequalities.
A Briton's chance of finding a good school, or effective treatment for a medical condition, or any kind of NHS dentist, may depend on the ‘postcode lottery’. Thus not just the management of the economy but specific policies on public services create winners and losers[ … ].
An Ayrton Senna (tenner) buys you 15 minutes of madness at Daytona & Indianapolis.
Youngsters now talk of borrowing an Ayrton Senna (tenner), of feeling Calvin Klein (fine) or being Terry Waite (late).
[T]he developing argument is that localism requires postcode lotteries; this is something that politicians need to become accustomed to if the local variations result from decisions at the local level by empowered citizens. However, there is some evidence which suggests that the public remain in favour of the equity argument over postcode lotteries.
“Here, an Ayrton Senna. Now if you can get the crisps and Pepsi, don't forget the mints, I'm going to get a 'nother name.”
What has mainly concerned patients has been the regional variations in treatments available (the postcode lottery), the pressure on A & E [accident and emergency] departments, the lack of resources for post-hospital care and the provision of a seven-day hospital service (which has involved a bitter contractual dispute with junior doctors).
The discussion of 'street-level bureaucrats' in Chapter 2 set out a strong theoretical basis for scepticism about whether it is possible to avoid a postcode lottery, even in situations where services are controlled centrally. The potential points of variation and the ways in which culture in different front-line delivery institutions can affect results persist despite control mechanisms being imposed. So there is good reason to believe that the postcode lottery will continue even in situations of ostensible central control.

Near or distant, blood or water, it's all one.
A sixth reason cited against allowing women in combat is that the presence of women will lead to sexual fraternization and disruption of discipline.

At 4pm, the phone went. It was The Sun: 'We hear your daughter's been expelled for cheating at her school exams...', She'd made a remark to a friend at the end of the German exam and had been pulled up for talking., As they left the exam room, she muttered that the teacher was a 'twat'. He heard and flipped—a pretty stupid thing to do, knowing the kids were tired and tense after exams. Instead of dropping it, the teacher complained to the Head and Deb was carpeted.

Australia has always been prone to bush fires due to its woody landscape.
The folks at VAWA were kickass, their politics were completely right on and it's total West Wing. People are there trying to affect change in this certain context. And it was so heartening in this way seeing people being so right on. It was also kind of scary to see people being so right on and this was the best completely right on people could do in the system at this point (SFA).
The Australian bush fires of January 1994 were the result of a combination of factors: intense heat during the day (>40°C), for a number of days, causing plants to ignite later; lightning; littering of cigarettes; arson; and the dry weather, which made the vegetation extremely dry.
The whole underground scene where we come from is just so right on and maybe that's the way we justify why we've pursued this so far on this level is to maybe open doors, some doors that have been opened for us, by bands who've made dents, who've preceded us.

If you were a first-time visitor from Mars and you happened to drop into a marketing meeting somewhere in the United States, you might assume that marketing people do nothing but talk about "TGIF."

The critics, however, sunder out one of the number and arbitrarily assign it to a different document from the rest.

The first step towards the new order came with the Whitlam Government of 1972-75. Proudly Australian, it abandoned imperial honours and introduced the Order of Australia.

Beer was lumped in with the rest of booze, and for 13 awful years, not one legal drop of precious amber fluid could be found between San Francisco and New York City.

Afternoon tea remains at its present price of 4s, but the prices of all other main meals have risen by 1s. Thus a full breakfast now costs 10s, lunch 13s 6d and dinner 14s 6d or 16s 6d according to train.
Everyone should indulge in a formal afternoon tea at least once while in London. This relaxing, drawn-out, civilized affair consists of three courses, all elegantly served on fine china: dainty finger sandwiches (with the crusts cut off, of course); then fresh-baked scones served with jam and deliciously decadent clotted cream (the rich, thick cream is also known as Devonshire cream); and lastly, an array of bite-size sweets. All the while, an indulgent server keeps the pot of your choice fresh at hand.

For Northton's young males, to " get over " on a woman – that is, to lure her into sex with vague promises of love and marriage; to get over on a woman and, particularly, to impregnate one (or three or five), and to " get away without being held legally accountable for out-of-wedlock children " is to prove strength, virility, and status. To a number of underclass youths, love is only another hustle.

Hellriegel's program tells him who is receiving a lot of votes (long periods of busy signals) and who is not (easy to ring through), and the website tells viewers who is most likely to go home – rather than who is most likely to stay.
That is called libel tourism by lawyers in the media trade.

Many Americans were primarily Europeanists in their approach to foreign affairs, dismissing Asia as relatively unimportant. But the United States is a Pacific power, and rapid changes were taking place in Asia—where more than half the human race lived—that might well determine the world's future. Japan would soon be the world's third-ranking industrial power, behind the United States and the Soviet Union. Some of the most rapid rates of economic progress anywhere were being achieved by the nations of non-Communist Asia. And mainland China potentially posed the greatest threat to peace during the final third of the twentieth century.

Shorty the Sixth, as he was sometimes called, had been a very winning puppy, and they had kept him at home until he began to exhibit the same tendencies that Duane's blue heelers always exhibited, that is, a tendency to herd children in the same way they would have herded cattle or sheep: they nipped their heels.

You can see it here in mortgages. Low-doc loans used to carry at least 1% or more of risk premium. As everybody [piled] in, that has been driven down to half a percent. These people do not have a verifiable income, and yet you can only expect them to be charged half a percent more on the interest rate.
I started going to the record exchange in Camden two or three times a week to look for the Rephlex white labels or test pressings that would end up there. I actually got one of the original Caustic Window vinyl LPs from there.
In a no-doc or low-doc loan, the lender doesn′t require you to bring proof of your income, but you will usually have to pay a higher interest rate or extra fees to get the loan. Lenders generally charge more for no-doc/low-doc loans.
His young wife ... was at church with her mother, and suddenly overcome by indisposition, arising from her interesting condition, she could not remain standing, she drove home in the first sledge, a smart-looking one, she came across.

The implication was that the driver reviver was a conspiracy designed to marginalise Catholics and that the organisers could expect a final reckoning. Indeed, there was a final reckoning. By the end of the Easter break, volunteers had made 18,000 cups of tea and coffee, all offered as a gesture of friendship to strangers, but evidently the work of Satan.

The best of the Stürmer und Dränger grew out of their Sturm und Drang, and it was necessary to indicate in what ways [Johann Gottfried] Herder and [Johann Wolfgang von] Goethe changed as they grew older. It should be stressed, however, that the very principles which forced them to burst the husk of the Sturm und Drang are in themselves a vital element within the Sturm und Drang.
[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich] Hegel's further observation shows the route taken by those who survived their Sturm und Drang and went on to produce more: "Because the sickness is in the essence itself, its isolated manifestations can be repressed [zurückdrängen] and the superficial symptoms suppressed [dämpfen]."
It was precisely this reason, science and the eighteenth-century Enlightenment to account for genius in rational terms that allowed the non-rational thinkers who fueled the fires of the Sturm und Drang movement to vivify, and elaborate upon, the ancient Greek notion of genius as a numinous power associated with the Muses and the gods.
The strongest link to the State, however, occurs with quangos, (quasi-NGOs), and the many umbrella groups that also thrive on State support. Many of the new parties realized after their Sturm und Drang years that they still needed regular contacts with the 'civil' world and that their civilian support base had been seriously eroded.
House Republicans had an additional worry. For all their Sturm und Drang, few provisions of the "Contract With America" had actually made their way into law. And their leadership had committed a serious tactical error when it shut down the federal government during a November 1995 budget dispute with the White House, a maneuver that backfired when the public blamed the Republicans, rather than Bill Clinton, for the fiasco.

Cuvier & Valenciennes state that the first ray of the dorsal of P. nigricans is prolonged in a filament. Is this a lapsus digiti for first ray of the pectoral?

The author of an introductory book on algebraic geometry has the difficult task of providing geometrical insight and examples, while at the same time developing the modern technical language of the subject. For in algebraic geometry, a great gap appears to separate the intuitive ideas which form the point of departure from the technical methods used in modern research. The first question is that of language. Algebraic geometry has developed in waves, each with its own language and point of view.
There I began to breathe a little freer, and to give a loose to those warm emotions which the sight of such an encounter had raised in me.
The use of curves in algebraic geometries, in applications such as coding and cryptography, now has an extensive literature and has been responsible for dramatic developments in both subjects.

Over time, they accumulated a tidy nest egg and retired comfortably.
When Mrs. Carey was married she had three hundred pounds, and this money, carefully watched, had been used by her to meet any unforeseen expense, any urgent charity, or to buy Christmas and birthday presents for her husband and for Philip. In the course of years it had diminished sadly, but it was still with the Vicar a subject for jesting. He talked of his wife as a rich woman and he constantly spoke of the "nest egg".
This is just like "Easy Rider." Except, now it's our turn. I mean, we can drop out and we can still have our nest egg!

Riemannian geometry was introduced by Riemann in 1854 as the n-dimensional generalization of the theory of curved surfaces of the 3D Euclidean space.
Riemannian geometry has found many applications in science, the most spectacular of these being the theory of relativity.[ … ]Every Riemannian geometry has geodesics, which are defined as the shortest curves joining two points.
At the beginning of the seventies, A. Gray generalized the classical holonomy concept by introducing a classification principle for non-integrable special Riemannian geometries [and] discovered in this context nearly Kähler manifolds in dimension six and nearly parallel G₂-manifolds in dimension seven.

Book 1: Reason alone teaches us to know good and bad. . . . Before the age of reason we do good and bad without knowing it, and there is no morality in our actions. . . . A child wants to upset everything he sees; he smashes, breaks everything he can reach. Book 4: We hold that no child who dies before the age of reason will be deprived of eternal happiness. . . . The whole difference I see here between you and me is that you claim that children have this capacity [i.e., to recognize the divinity] at seven, and I do not even accord it to them at fifteen.

‘New chum?’ queried the barman, after serving him. ‘I suppose I am,’ replied Jim. ‘Look here, would you mind telling me what in the devil′s name a new chum is?' ‘A new chum is a man fresh from home.’ ‘From England?' ‘Scotland, Ireland, anywhere else, if he′s green and inexperienced. Miners from the Californian fields don′t rank as new chums.’ 'And how am I known as a new chum?’ The barman grinned. ‘That′ll tell on you all over the place,’ he said, indicating the bag. ‘That′s a true new chum′s bundle. No Australian would expatriate himself by carrying his goods in that fashion. He makes them up in a roll, straps them, and carries them in a sling on his back. His bundle is then a swag. The swag is the Australian′s national badge.’
All the signs are right this time / You don't have to try so very hard / If you live in this world / You're feelin' the change of the guard
Once, said he, a new chum came to the jarrah bush. A new chum is a tenderfoot, specifically an English tenderfot; he is, of course, the butt of every bush and mining camp in Australia.

Being a new chum at Fairbridge meant that I had to go through a lengthy period of initiation all over again.
Moreover, his fantasy and idealization of Paris, characteristic of Paris syndrome, played a great part in his abnormal behaviors searching for his lost youth and love affaire.^([sic])
The Paris syndrome apparently affects only the Japanese and only when visiting Paris; women in their early thirties on their first international trip are particularly prone to the affliction.
This acceptance applies to ‘new chums’ in Australia as well as the folks at Home. Much of the evidence that Australians disliked ‘new chums’ comes from Alexander Harris who, as a ‘new chum’ himself, was quite well treated by the ‘old hands’. The emphasis of colonial disdain was on the ‘new’ rather than the ‘chum’.
Between 1854 (and the addition of in-patient facilities) and 1870 the mortality rates in the Wakefield Infirmary averaged out to 9.94 per cent for in-patients and 3.18 per cent for out-patients.

He didn′t always play the same poker machine, but he never went to the tables where he would have to interact with a live dealer. In fact, he usually stuck to the row of poker machines closer to the back door.

The fastidious and solitary public-schoolboy [George Orwell] dosses down with tramps and tarts and forces himself to endure bedbugs and chamberpots and lockups.

If she sends her son for the money she is a gold digger, and if she sends her daughter, she is a gold digger teaching her daughter how to be a gold digger—two offenses for the price of one.

The political influence wielded by many of the court ladies, and especially by the first lady-in-waiting (mother of the present Emperor), bears a certain resemblance to that which the eunuchs wielded under the later Manchus at the court of Peking. … And behind the 30 ladies-in-waiting there are the rank and file of female palace attendants, some 300, all of Kyoto stock—quite sufficient to keep any conscientious chamberlain on the qui vive.

‘Revelation’, to a philosopher such as Plotinus, was not merely irrational: it led to second-rate counterfeits of traditional academic philosophical culture. It was as if the inhabitants of an underdeveloped country were to seek to catch up with western technology by claiming to have learnt nuclear physics through dreams and oracles.
It is a slight miracle, I think, that in the almost two years since February of 1960 there has not been a fatality. But we have come amazingly close to it several times. Let me mention the case of William Barbee who was on the Freedom Ride when it arrived at Montgomery and met with mob violence.[…]
After a day of hauling concrete, she was pretty well tuckered out.
The Freedom Rides had reached their peak in June but were not over, and the ferment stirred up by them had by no means subsided. … It was the Nashville Student Movement that had continued the Freedom Rides when CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], the original sponsor, had declared them too dangerous and had withdrawn. These students had a right to feel proud and sure of themselves.
She staggered through the reeds to the island ahead and flattened on the ground. Didn’t know how long she had been running. Panting and tuckered out.
Abbie [Hoffman] took his freedom ride at the tail end of the freedom movement. He had missed the chance to be among the Freedom Riders of 1961 or the Freedom School teachers of 1964, and he was determined not to let the South slip through his fingers again. The summer of 1965 would be the last time that significant numbers of Northern whites would go to Mississippi for civil rights, and Abbie would be among them.
The year of the first Aboriginal freedom ride is the year the principal of Fineflour Central boards up a group of kids in the toilet block roof.
Led by young activists, black and white, who were conducting ‘freedom rides’ modelled on those of the civil rights movement in the United States, a change in attitudes was in progress which would lead in 1967 to the removal, by a large majority in a referendum, of the provision in the Constitution that prevented the Parliament from making 'special laws' in the interests of Aboriginals.
Then, in February 1965, Charles Perkins led the famous and extremely effective freedom rides that made him probably Australia's best known civil rights activist. … The freedom rides were an extremely dangerous and confronting form of public protest. At one stage the bus was run off the road in Walgett after being pursued by a truck and ten cars, and the bus driver later withdrew from the tour because of safety concerns.

The editorial advised parents of small children to limit their kids' screen time.
A growing number of activists believe the time has come for the public to stop asking that some space be left unsponsored, and to begin seizing it back. Culture jamming baldly rejects the idea that marketing — because it buys its way into our public spaces — must be passively accepted as a one-way information flow.
The government ordered the spies to be terminated with extreme prejudice: they did not want them to expose what they knew in a public trial.
...suggested that he either be isolated or ‘terminated with extreme prejudice.’ This term is said to be an intelligence euphemism for execution.
Culture jamming is, at root, just a metaphor for stopping the flow of spectacle long enough to adjust your set.
Instead of simply using non-spectacular or non-ironic factual information, rational argumentation, legal strategies, and traditional political tactics to oppose capitalist institutions directly, culture jamming turns the commercial techniques of image and emotion back on themselves through what Umberto Eco called “semiological guerrilla warfare.”
Although its numbers remain small, the contribution of the Church of the SubGenius is influential; the aggressive culture jamming of the COSG is a strikingly original innovation in contemporary religion, and the penetration of its teachings concerning J.R. ‘Bob’ Dobbs, the Conspiracy, Mutantis and the ancestral role of the Yeti (and more) into underground publishing and guerrilla media (both online and offline) has been remarkably stimulating and fruitful.

The unfortunate thing about calling the season seven finale “The Dragon And The Wolf” is you can’t even reference it by name without picturing Daenerys Targaryen’s long-awaited hook-up with Jon Snow, her strapping hunk of an ally and also her nephew.

When Carmen quipped in, “Well, Mr. President somebody has to put the bee on them,” the General asserted, “It won't be me, never.”

[T]hey never could see the Missionaries dispose of their legs in the attitude of kneeling, or hear them begin a hymn in chorus, without bursting into roars of irrepressible laughter. It is much to be hoped that no member of this facetious tribe may ever find his way to England and get committed for contempt of Court.
[I...] thank the Prime Minister for his remarks, which were very clear; but it does sound very much to me like a Kathleen Mavourneen proposition. The eventual removal will take place, but when is a question that no one can answer as yet. It will be done some time in the future.
On the same day, Judge Walsh issued a contempt of court decree against Chair Peter McDonald and the Navajo tribal government for having failed to comply with his order to reduce Dine livestock in the JUA.
The Attorney General applied for an order for contempt of court against the New Statesman.
The Hon. F. R. H. Lavery: That is a Kathleen Mavourneen undertaking. The Hon. A. F. GRIFFITH: It is not. The Hon. F. R. H. Lavery: Past experience has shown that so many things have been promised but have not eventuated.
When defendant committed the contempts of court at issue here, he was not at the time incarcerated in a penal or reformatory institution and he was not an escapee.
… and rode to varsity on a bike, which was considered 'infra dig.' for nice girls. Not that she cared about appearances. She earned extra money when she could and in her third year had a ‘Kathleen Mavourneen’ loan arranged through the registrar. ‘Kathleen Mavourneen’? The tag had currency from an Irish song popular at community sings, with the punch line ‘It may be for years and it may be for ever.’ Such a loan was interest-free, but Kath wasn't the sort to leave it for ever.

And, as audience members, we have all experienced death by PowerPoint, the comatose state that results from being subjected to one stultifying slide after another.
[W]e turn now to explore four additional Hippocratic works that promise to shed more light on the values and conduct of the ancient physician. [ … ] Since they address such topics as professional conduct between physicians, bedside manners, proper decorum, and handling difficult patients, these four works are traditionally counted as the basic Hippocratic guide to sound medical etiquette.
Our bedside manner matters because it indicates to patients whether they can trust us. Where there is no trust, there can be little healing. A good bedside manner is not static: It develops in coordination with the patients' needs, but it is grounded in the timeless clinical virtues of honesty, humor, and humility in the presence of human weakness and human suffering.
But they share the same age (both are 37) and a friendly bedside manner that allows them to make even the cagiest of chief executives feel at home.

For a man raised since birth to be strong, resolute, spare with words, and never to bow to the weepings and handwringings of the weaker sex, he had poured out his heart in that letter.
"There's always a reason behind a lie. People can be very good at lying. Women can be especially good at it because they're the weaker sex and we, that's what the books say, and we want to protect them and not have anyone take advantage of them. At least I do," Farese said during closing statements Wednesday.
Our plans to go to France died in the ass.
The Jewish reaction to blood libels appears less articulated than we might have expected, because although it denied any Jewish culpability, it internalized some of the narratives which nourished the ritual murder accusations.

Listen to Florida Democrat Peter Deutsch last night on Crossfire: “Let me just talk a little bit about... the worst statements I have ever heard probably in my life about anything. I mean, almost a blood libel by the Republicans towards Al Gore, saying that he was trying to stop men and women in uniform that are serving this country from voting.” .... You don't just toss around charges that the possible next president of the United States is conspiring to take the vote away from American soldiers overseas.

Just because we live out in the global wop wops, geographically-speaking - both derivation and historical usage are given on page 923, by the way - or perhaps because we do live more than a thousand kilometres from our nearest English-speaking neighbours who, too, have evolved their own form of the tongue - we have developed our own ways of describing things, talking together, sharing our observations and views.

The basic concepts of Euclidean geometry of the plane are the point and the (straight) line; in spherical geometry, the corresponding concepts are the point and the great circle.
In short order, Friday the 13th (the first widely distributed major studio slasher flick), Terror Train and Prom Night – the latter two starring uber-scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis [ … ]– led the charge into cinemas. With the formula nailed down – masked killer stalks and slays teenagers on a particular holiday or special event – everyone and their cousin could assemble their own cheapie horror flick and as a result, quality slumped as quantity multiplied.
Confessions of a Scream Queen by Matt Beckoff (BearManor Media) is a series of interviews with actresses associated with horror films (using a very loose definition of the term "scream queen").
Due to the way the geometry of a sphere's surface differs from that of the plane, spherical geometry has some features of a non-Euclidean geometry and is sometimes described as being one. Historically, however, spherical geometry was not considered a fully fledged (non-Euclidean) geometry capable of resolving the question of whether the parallel postulate is a logical consequence of the rest of Euclid's axioms of plane geometry.
But he was a born leader. As danger thickened his jaunty manner would increase, his speech become more racy, his cold eyes glitter into ardent life, and his Don Quixote moustache bristle with joyous excitement.
Spherical trigonometry presupposes spherical geometry, for example the properties of great circles and spherical triangles, much of which was already known; it had been investigated as soon as astronomy became mathematical, during the time of the later Pythagoreans.
We start with spherical geometries. The two geometries on spheres of radiuses R₁ and R₂ are obviously identical if R₁ = R₂; moreover, the converse also holds.
To collect the boundary of the point set in the tree we pass a bounding box (for Euclidean geometries) or the universal set (for spherical geometries) to the root of the tree.
It has been at least fifty years since spherical geometry and spherical trigonometry have been a regular part of the high school or undergraduate curriculum.

The organizers claim these fun, upbeat gatherings are non-partisan in nature and have nothing to do with political protest.

[ … ] Cullen skink is to the Hebrides what clam chowder is to New England. In fact, it's very similar to clam chowder, the main difference being that instead of clams, Cullen skink calls for smoked haddock.
Like most traditional Scottish cooking, Cullen skink is simple, rib-sticking fare made from a handful of ingredients. It starts with a smoked haddock, known locally as a finnan haddie. The fish is gently poached in milk with onions, then flaked. The bones may go back into the pot for simmering to make the base of the soup. The strained broth is then thickened with mashed potato, a delicious way for a cook to use up last night's leftovers.

In treating a sand boil, all particles of sand must be removed, wet compresses applied for a day or two, the leg kept at rest, dry lint and adhesive plaster being afterwards used.

Only thing notable here is when I got crushed trying to take Barry's BB (I was SB). Raised him a couple thousand with K9s, then he went allin. I should have folded, as I needed to call about T7000 more, for about a T13500 pot, but without really thinking I stacked off on him. He had KQ, and I couldn't suck out.

1920 The snow was too thick and the ruts frozen too hard for the motor. They drove out in a clumsy high carriage. Tucked over them was a blue woolen cover, prickly to her wrists, and outside of it a buffalo robe, humble and moth-eaten now, used ever since the bison herds had streaked the prairie a few miles to the west. — Lewis Sinclair, Main Street.

But when I got to Anita Bryant′s pound cake, I stopped looking. Her recipe is my favorite so far. The cream isn′t quite authentic—real pound cakes are supposed to contain only butter, sugar, eggs and flour—but it does make the cake′s texture meltier.
Pound cakes, butter cakes with a tender fine crumb, are English in origin. In the 1700s and 1800s, the basic cake formula was based on the pound cake—butter, sugar, flour, and eggs in equal proportions by weight, with no chemical leavening added.
Satisfied her aunt had things under control, Addy put on the coffee and sliced and arranged the pound cake on a cookie sheet.

Mutual information I(X;Y) between two random variables X and Y is what is left over when their mutual conditional entropies H(Y|X) and H(X|Y) are subtracted from their joint entropy H(X,Y). It can be given by the formula I(X;Y)=-∑ₓ∑_yp_X,Y(x,y) log _bp_X,Y(x,y)/p_X|Y(x|y)p_Y|X(y|x).

If random variables X and Y are mutually independent, then their joint entropy H(X,Y) is just the sum H(X)+H(Y) of its component entropies. If they are not mutually independent, then their joint entropy will be H(X)+H(Y)-I(X;Y) where I(X;Y) is the mutual information of X and Y.

During the years that the herd was being replenished by purchase abortions were frequent, but that practice was discontinued, and the heifer calves born in the herd have been raised. … Thus a herd immunity seems to have developed as a result both of keeping the aborting cows and raising the calves.
It is likely that many animals in affected herds have developed an inapparent or nonclinical form of the disease because there have been no records of recurrence of the disease on the same farm—an indication that a herd immunity developed.
A' forgot te ask 'er fo' me money back!, Wye, shy bairns get nowt.
Jews, long exposed to some diseases in the confined quarters of European ghettos, had developed herd immunities through a long process of natural selection.
Aye, Mary, we heard you. How could we not? Ah well, shy bairns get nowt. Will we let her at the microphone and give me a bit peace?
For herd immunity to occur, the vaccine must prevent transmission of the virus as well as prevent disease.
Some proponents of natural rearing condemn vaccinations; they prefer using homeopathic nosodes (medicine prepared from the diseased part or discharge of something, which supposedly works as well as vaccination). These people point to their dogs' good health as proof that nosodes work. However, their good fortune is probably the result of herd immunity, that is, as long as most dogs are vaccinated, the unvaccinated dogs rarely come in contact with the infectious agents.
Ask questions, enquire, and push for more information and care. As the saying goes in the north-east, ‘shy bairns get nowt’! Know your rights and what you are entitled to by pushing and not taking no for an answer.
Many examples of herd immunity have been described, illustrating the importance of indirect protection for predicting the short- and long-term impact of vaccination programs, for justifying them economically, and for understanding the nature of the immunity induced by various vaccines.
An old Geordie saying says: ‘Shy bairns get nowt!’ It literally means ‘shy children get nothing’, but is used to emphasise that people should speak up for themselves. I think that this saying applies to leaders.
A few weeks ago, the U.K. had almost no social-isolation measures in place, and according to some reports, the government planned to let the virus run its course through the population, with the exception of the elderly, who were to be kept indoors. The idea was to let enough people get sick and recover from the mild version of the disease, to create "herd immunity." Things changed swiftly after an epidemiological model from Imperial College London projected that without drastic interventions, more than half a million Britons would die from COVID-19.

Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-Oxbridge trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of Western civilization. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they commissioned paintings, perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent. No one knows who came up with it, but their adventures soon had a perfectly appropriate name: the Grand Tour.
The River Frome feeds into the Avon in the centre of Bristol.
As such, it is indicative of the fact that by the 1780s a more informed interest in the history of the middle ages and the 'gothic' era was already beginning to make itself felt amongst the literate travelling public, even in that most classical of environments, the Grand Tour. The Grand Tour as a cultural institution underwent a fundamental change in character during the nineteenth century, as we saw in the introduction, both in terms of itinerary and the composition of the travelling classes.

In 1896 . . . work was again started with two engines and steam pumps, with the intention of pumping out the "money pit".
Baldwin's phosphorus is prepared by melting nitrate of lime in a crucible or ladle for about ten minutes; it is then poured into an iron pot, or mould, previously heated, and has the property, like Canton's phosphorus, of absorbing light when exposed to the sun, and emitting it when taken into a darkened room.
Edward Reichert, a New Yorker, was planning "a gigantic project" . . . to move in power excavation equipment to seek the storied "money pit".
The Money Pit shaft rested atop two 500 foot "protection tunnels" which were connected to the bay.
Canton's phosphorus is made by calcining oyster-shells in the open fire for half an hour; after which, the whitest and largest pieces are selected, mixed with about one-third their weight of flowers of sulphur, pressed into a crucible with a closely-luted cover, and heated red hot for an hour.
and the Bolognian phosphorus, discovered by Vincenzo Cascariolo, a shoemaker of Bologna, is made by reducing compact sulphate of baryta to a fine powder, which is formed into cakes with mucilage, and these are heated to redness.
Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!
But these sums were but a small part of their income, were merely pin money for their wives and children.
The radiated or stellated variety of this sulphate includes the Bologna stone of Monte Paterno, used in the preparation of the Bononian phosphorus
and Homberg found, that if it (muriate of lime) was urged by a violent heat till it condensed, on cooling, into a vitreous mass, it emitted a phosphoric light upon being struck by any hard body, in which state it was called Homberg's phosphorus

I'll be watching the fucker like a hawk with a Birmingham screwdriver to the ready should I spot anything untoward.
Chlorine trifluoride, ClF₃, or "CTF" as the engineers insist on calling it, is a colorless gas, a greenish liquid, or a white solid. It boils at 12° (so that a trivial pressure will keep it liquid at room temperature) and freezes at a convenient —76°... It is also quite probably the most vigorous fluorinating agent in existence—much more vigorous than fluorine itself... It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that's the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water—with which it reacts explosively.
“I feel like I've been walloped with a Birmingham screwdriver!”

Most construction phase agreements and some pre-construction agreements contain a time is of the essence provision. If time is of the essence, a delay caused by the fault of the construction manager would constitute a breach of contract and could result in the construction manager's being liable for damages incurred by the owner as a result of the delay. If there is no time is of the essence provision, reasonableness will be the guide when measuring the timelines of the services provided by the construction manager.
In a variety of contracts, the courts have held that the requirement that time is of the essence should be applied to the respective obligations of both parties (examples are between (a) buyer and seller, (b) ship owner and charterer, (c) purchaser and vendor, and (d) contractor and owner).

The Food and Drug Administration has cautioned the corn industry over its use of the term "corn sugar" to describe high fructose corn syrup before the proposed new name has received regulatory approval.

The best-known aphrodisiac is Spanish fly, which is made from the wings of the blister beetle. Spanish fly creates a condition known as priapism in men. This is long-standing erection, which sounds good in theory. Unfortunately, Spanish fly removes all sensitivity from the organ, rendering it ineffective. In women the results are more severe. These include depression, vomiting, inflammation of the kidneys, and even death.
The Spanish fly abounds in the south of France, Spain, and Italy, and is found on the ash, lilac, privet, elder, honeysuckle, plum, willow, and elm trees.[ … ]The American fly is rather smaller than the Spanish fly, and of a much darker color.

It is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called by the Latins æs alienum, another’s brass, for some of their coins were made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other’s brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, to-morrow, and dying to-day, insolvent.

It is interesting to compare Oberon's love juice with the love potion that Tristan and Isolde drink [ … ]
The elderly woman was offended when she saw the young couple performing dirty dancing on the dance floor at the reception.
A very few thrusts brought down my love juice again, and I also felt him shoot a tremendously warm flood of his essence into my longing cunt.

A considerable number of species of birds build their nests in close proximity to, or even inside of, nests of aggressive, stinging insects—bees, wasps, and ants. Thus, in eastern Africa, Loveridge (1922) found in the case of a little weaver, the cordon bleu, Uraeginthus angolensis (Linnaeus), that in 19 out of 20 instances the birds built their nests ...
Alex barked a laugh, surprising both of them. "Butt chin? What does that mean?" "It's got a crack in it, like a butt. Daddy had the butt chin, too."
Other Uraeginthus species are much more social; e.g., the Angolan blue waxbill (or blue-breasted cordon bleu, U. angolensis) tends to breed in a semi-colonial manner, with each pair occupying a clump of bushes (Skead, 1975; Goodwin, 1982).

A long pause was followed by Hannah saying, “Well, no duh!”, “What?”, “That sign. Did you read that sign?”, “No, what did it say?”, “It said ‘State Prison Next Exit: Do Not Pick Up Hitchhikers.’ That′s why I said, no duh!

I moved my hands up a little more and discovered, to put it delicately, the object of my desire left much to be desired. In not so delicate terms, fully erect—and I mean as hard as a diamond—his dick was about half as long as a bun-length hot dog, with about the same girth as said hot dog. I had heard the term needle dick before, but I swear, I had never encountered one.

In retrospect, during the '80s, when I could have been fucked by half of the gay ghetto, I took care of myself by loving a supportive, nurturing partner. He was far from perfect. He had a bad temper and knew nothing about the arts.

The message of the astronauts, however, was not primarily one of Christmas cheer, and had nothing to do with the "Prince of Peace" or the "spirit of the season." Instead, it consisted of a dramatic reading of the first ten verses of the Book of Genesis, the story of the creation of the world.

He stood behind an old and dilapidated Stobie pole and eyed me and my pushbike.
Come on up to my place on the third floor.
However, the lack of trees in South Australia severely constrained the use of timber and led to the early and widespread use of a steel-concrete composite pole, called a Stobie pole after its designer.

She's shopping around for a new boyfriend.
The viewer as outsider is invited to contemplate the ‘primitive vitality’ of an alien, multi-ethnic, and lower-class culture. In [James] Cameron’s screenplay [of Titanic (1997)], Rose (Kate Winslet), a young society woman, ‘meets cute’ with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor artist who has won a lottery earning him a passage on the maiden voyage of the fated liner.
If you're not married, then this is a cute meet. I'm a sucker for meeting cute.
Before you ask some girl for her hand now / Keep your freedom for as long as you can now / My mama told me, you better shop around.
" Are there any raisins in the store-cupboard ? " I next asked weakly. " I noticed there were not many in the spotted dog pudding we had the other day."
Girl no longer do I / Have to shop around any more, no no no / I've found that once in a lifetime / Girl that I've been searching for
If you don't know what spotted dog is, it's one of those beastly steamed pudding things with an occasional raisin in it that boarding schools feed their inmates on because it's cheap, not in the least nourishing, and nearly guaranteed to keep them contented until tea time.
The source of the trouble was the spotted dog. Spotted dog is a sort of pudding, made from dough with currants embedded.
He's shopping around his book to several studios. He hopes to get a movie deal.
By the time I reached the Navy my love of steam preceded me, and I became the stoker for a rickety steam cutter inherited from the Maine. Pride wenteth before a fall; I put the slice bar through one of the cutter’s tubes — and lost my job in a hasty exit over the side.
Brock’s foot touched the plate just as he and Freehan’s mitt with the ball in it met. Normally, a tie was given to the runner, but the umpire must have believed that pride wenteth before a fall and called Brock out.
I wanted to do a show that wasn’t ha-ha funny but peculiar funny.
"Pity for you though, all the same, you could have tried your luck there — she'll open her legs for grammar-school boys, sure as eggs.", "But if she's not much to look at anyway," I said [ … ]
“He’s a funny man. Not ha-ha funny, just crazy funny.
‘I once got clap after a bump supper,’ said Blanford gloomily, ‘and it wasn't gay at all. It took ages to get itself cured.’
His only problem with them is that they don’t appreciate his style of joke. ... Not ha-ha funny maybe, but no one had even smiled.
I always thought of Thoreau’s puns as more clever than ha-ha funny.
“Someone grabbed me from behind and said ‘No duff,’ which means this is real,” said LCdr. Wong. “That’s what everybody heard, ‘Plane crash, 737,’ and all of us started running to our posts,” he told reporters after Prime Minister Stephen Harper arrived here to commend those who raced to the scene.
Get him in here, and radio a ‘no duff’ [casualty] to HQ.
What do you mean, funny? Funny peculiar or funny ha-ha?
Leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are the principal types of blood cancer.
In the morning, she couldn’t remember much, only that the dream left her feeling kind of funny inside. Not funny ha-ha, but funny weird-like.

Mostly he makes jokes about Mum’s cooking. Not the funny ha-ha jokes, more the sneery, condescending snipes that leave an uncomfortable silence, while you decide whose side you should be on.
Others showed that their creators were hip to the dialect, as does the cartoon by Jeff Fanzinger (see the photo and cartoon inser following page 160), in which he exploits authentic Ebonics lingo - chillin, main man, dat's whuzzup, and nome sane (a condensed version of "Know what I'm saying?") that has become popular in the black community.
She laughs, not a funny ha-ha laugh but rather a tiny self-inflicted chuckle of disgust.

Court decisions have established that super PACs are supposed to act independently of a candidate, with no coordination permitted. But the indictment focused on the suspicious timing of hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Mr. Menendez’s re-election campaign from a generous friend who allegedly sought government favors through the senator’s influence.
I laugh when talking about this; it is not the funny ha-ha kind of laugh, but the uncomfortable kind.
You have political correctness, we have religious correctness.
In this way c surmounted by an inverted circumflex accent stands for our sound of ch, which in Russian, Polish, or Servian words, we usually see spelled cz.
The notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land. And although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudice with new ones.
You mean I’m watching your sperm blossoms because you’re training to be a stripper?!
I mean, people who talk about political correctness as being a kind of thought police have no idea of what a thought police is. But political correctness does have the same mentality. It means that intellectual argument is doomed. Objective truth simply becomes a thing to jeer at, because obviously there's no such thing as objectivity—unless of course you're politically okay, in which case you can be objective. Any child can see through that, but many adults can't.
“The N.S.A. would obviously prefer that quantum computing were not possible,” said Dr. Seth Lloyd, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But if it does turn out to be possible, then they need to be prepared.”

Political correctness cripples discourse, creates ugly language and is generally stupid.
The Gullimots [under latin-1] become T and t with inverted hats under Latin-2, oe and G with an inverted hat under Latin-3.
By 1979, thousands had 'gapped it', or taken the chicken run, as emigration was derisively known [ … ]
Now, one (obviously) has to have the basic ‘Roman’ alphabet. [¶] Then there are all the diacritical markings (accent, accent grave, dot umlaut, ring, bar, ‘hat’, inverted hat, etc.) for vowels.
July 11, 1946, the first station wagon went into production. It has the familiar Jeep “front-end look” with radiator grid, bonnet, front fenders, cowl, dash, windshield assembly and door assemblies identical with those in panel delivery, 2- and 4-wheel drive trucks and the new station sedan.
The Motions of the ſix Primary Planets round the Sun is So adjuſted, that the Square of the Times of their peroidical [sic] Revolutions are as the Cubes of their Diſtances from the Sun : And the ſame thing is found by all Aſtronomers to be true, with Regard to the Motions of the Secondary Planets or Satellites round their primary ones. … But if the Orbit of the Satellite Planet, inſtead of being a Circle be an Ellipſis, in whoſe Focus the Primary Planet is ſuppoſed to be placed, then will the greater Axis of this Elliptical Orbit, twice advance forward, viz. in the 2 Quadratures, and twice recede backward, viz. in the 2 Syzygies, of every Revolution of the Satellite round the Planet.
The ‘Jeep’ Station Sedan combines the luxurious riding ease of a sedan with the spaciousness of a station-wagon.
My comments, of course, are partly taken care of by saying your data is old. It is inaccurate, to be quite frank, it is very inaccurate, it is not even close. Your game surveys are way off, your actual use is way off.
If you are accusing them, either consciously or subconsciously, of committing an evil act (a sin) that they didn't commit, then you are way off.
He noticed somebody come running around the corner and to the side of the station sedan nearer to the kerb, and get in.
There are people who correct me, and I know that they are way off.
Police throughout Australia were alerted to keep a lookout for a white or cream 1973–74 Holden Kingswood station sedan.
Just buy it or don't buy it. Either way, we have to get going.
I'm not sure if I can make it to the party. Either way, I'll let you know beforehand.
How was last night? Too much pound town and not enough necking, ya know?
The pages of the diary are chock full of fascinating reports of medical incidents of all sorts.
But the thought of her drugdealer boyfriend taking her to Pound Town in front of our potential child was, let's just say, out of my comfort zone.
My friend leaned back, pulling eight inches out of her and went to pound town using incredibly long thrusts.
"Chock full o' science," said the radiant Captain, "as ever he was!"
The pick of the output of the French and German toymakers was rushed by special delivery to the mansion; but Rachel refused to be comforted.
'Aha!' cried the old gentleman, folding his hands, and squeezing them with great force against each other. 'I see her now; I see her now! My love, my life, my bride, my peerless beauty. She is come at last--at last--and all is gas and gaiters!'
Late in the afternoon arrived a special delivery, mailed from some small New Jersey town.
The post office arranged special deliveries every half-hour to handle the flood of greetings.
Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska on Tuesday declared himself “against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.”
Mr. Walker does triumphantly claim the discovery of the inverted circumflex accent, or the downward and upward continued movement. Yet, if it is correctly inferred from the dates of publication, and from Mr. Walker’s rather derisive allusion to Mr. Steele’s essay, that the latter author preceded him, he might have found, in Mr. Steele’s gravo-acute accent, proof of the real existence of his newly found function of the voice.
When I visited the offices in March, the walls were bare, the furniture battered. With the addition of a dead plant, the suite could pass for a graduate-student lounge.
Doom has three running speeds (not counting wall humping): running, strafe-running, and strafe-drawing. Strafe-drawing is a little faster than strafe-running, but harder to control for distance.
If your application works with MathML, or in various languages whose character sets gained support in Unicode 3.1 through the so-called Astral Planes, you will need to know that what Java calls a char is not really the same thing as a Unicode character or an XML character.
I don't think this is a statement that players are stupid. Not at all. They know what's good. This is a statement that engaging in quests, exploration and wall humping is an activity with a similar motivation to rattling the bars of your jail cell: You ain't got nuthin better to do.
Medina was killed, then cooked, becoming the second inmate in seven years to suffer the Florida flambe.
The answer was UTF-16. Two blocks of 16-bit values were set aside for use as special values for encoding astral plane characters.
This is why harris should go down in Florida Flambe.
UTF-16 encodes every character from O—65535 as 2 bytes; it then uses some dirty hacks if you actually need to represent the rarely used astral plane Unicode characters beyond 65535.
The astral planes include some such characters, notably in the CJK extensions, without which it is impossible to write some people's names correctly.
“ Does it pay to breed cockatoos ?” said Archie innocently. “Don′t be the death o′ me, Johnnie. A cockatoo farmer is just a crofter. [ … ] ”
Such characters are in the so-called “Astral Planes,” with a code point above U+FFFF.
I still have about 30 lbs to lose, which I would love to lose in 3 months..and after reading all your guys's stories I have gained even more motivation.
The events of 1999 in Kosovo and East Timor provide an important opportunity to reflect on the practice of humanitarian intervention.
But not all codepoints are used equally. Those in the "astral plane", for example, are used rarely, so the vast majority of the time you would be using twice as much memory as strictly necessary.
But in some respects humanitarian intervention looks more like police work than war.
Let's assume you want to display a Unicode character via JavaScript that is in an astral plane (obviously, there is a risk when doing so: not all fonts support all such characters).
We need to open a bar at that airport. People need a stiff drink after being gate raped by the TSA.
“Mr. Mayor and fellow citizens,” it was thus he addressed the meeting the morning I returned to Waterford, “I came to attend this meeting, driving Irish tandem — that is one foot before the other.”
He was driving Irish tandem, but perhaps I talk at random – / I'd forgotten for a moment you are not all mulga-bred; / What I mean's he had his swag up through his having knocked his nag up

I accepted it as the 'momentary lapse of judgment' before posting a 'not appropriate' message to the newsgroup of a person who merely 'volunteered' to articulate a scenario that may have been on some Americans' minds in the hours following their watching of the Ejaculation Proclamation.
the curtain jet up later rather than sooner Monday fo' Slick's Ejaculation Proclamation.
Not sure what nation you're from or the nature of its legal system, but would you and your countrymen be concerned if serious allegations arose causing your leader of perjury, subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice? The great misperception is that it's about sex. Anyone who saw the "Ejaculation Proclamation" speech Monday night should know that's exactly what the Prez wants us to think -- it's between him, Hillary and his God. It's not.
Pink slime is allowed in any school in America by the USDA.
Exit stage left 47 dead bodies of the 112 known people who suffered from the unexplained attacks. This is a mortality rate of 42 percent.

As she buried her face deep in the cool pulp, even her cheeks became slicked with pink slime. She paid no attention to Gabe, chomping away on his melon next to her. Focus was the name of the game.
Baby beef is the term applied to young (15 months or under) very fat and light beeves that have been on full feed practically from birth, never having been allowed to lose their baby fat.
You can see a father's selfish genes at work in baby fat. Most mammals come into the world as skin and bones and quickly put on padding afterward.
I want to lose the baby fat! I am now 19 pounds away from my goal and I really wish I would have known how important it was to be back to my original weight before getting pregnant!
The tactics were more those of 1948 in Prague than St. Petersburg in 1917, consisting of the slow acquisition of positions in the army and the police, and the application of what used to be called “salami tactics” against other parties.
Senior Tories might thus prefer to avoid a further public backlash over the loss of any of the BBC's channels. So, salami tactics are more likely than wholesale closures. BBC Four is likely to be stripped down and relaunched as an arts channel, making it a more direct competitor to BSkyB's Sky Arts.
They analyze slash fiction (stories about romantic and sexual relationships between two male characters, some of which involve graphic descriptions of sex), and argue that the similarities between romance novels and slash fiction prove gender differences exist.
Over the years, slash writers have started dismissing as homophobic this trope of men having sex with men without identifying as homosexual or bisexual; nevertheless, much slash fiction retains the trope's underlying sentiment of true love and devotion transcending all external rules.
In hindsight, I regret not giving him a terrorist fist jab or the Islamist secret handshake. I hear he's quite adept at those.
Later, during the presidential campaign, one Fox commentator flippantly suggested Barack and wife Michelle had greeted each other with a "terrorist fist jab". The commentator later apologised, as did another Fox commentator who had joked about assassinating Obama and Osama bin Laden after supposedly muddling their names.
If you do something like this, I will be sure that you spend a long, long time in the graybar hotel.

The walls in Eduardo's row house were so thin he could hear the neighbors two houses down.
His technical skills were limited to performing percussive maintenance: hitting malfunctioning equipment in the hope that it would then work.
Early trips reported trouble that seemed to be fixed by using a wrench to apply repeated doses of percussive maintenance.
There was a time when all that was required to use the office copier, printer or fax machine was the ability to fish out paper jams and a knack for percussive maintenance – known in layman's terms as a good hard thump.
The experiment was abandoned when one fine day spontaneous combustion of the pulverised coal in the container occurred, and a black cloud of the very finely divided fuel rose into the air by the force of the explosion, and was slowly wafted by the prevailing breeze over the town, upon which it descended with the resemblance of black snow, but with the dissimilarity that it did not melt.
The virus causing molluscum contagiosum is a member of the DNA pox family. It is particularly prevalent in underdeveloped countries, and afflicts over 20% of the population in some South Pacific regions. Children are its prime target, but adults can be affected as well.

The soldier's overseas cap, the one that opens up along the top, is called a cunt cap: it's hard to imagine any other piece of conventional headgear, like a policeman's visor cap or a bishop's miter or a motorcyclist's helmet treated automatically with such obscene disrespect.

Freedom of expression is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.
The country entered into peace talks with the militants.
Any test that turns on what is offensive to the community's standards is too loose, too capricious, too destructive of freedom of expression to be squared with the First Amendment. Under that test, juries can censor, suppress, and punish what they don’t like, provided the matter relates to "sexual impurity" or has a tendency "to excite lustful thoughts". This is community censorship in one of its worst forms. It creates a regime where in the battle between the literati and the Philistines, the Philistines are certain to win.
An indulgent playmate, Grannie would lay aside the long scratchy-looking letter she was writing (heavily crossed ‘to save notepaper’) and enter into the delightful pastime of ‘a chicken from Mr Whiteley's’.
Strode's Act in the Parliament of 1512 was the first statute to protect such early freedom of expression, although limited to members of Parliament.
Freedom of expression is essentially another, and perhaps more accurate, way of referring to the composite of rights usually labelled freedom of speech.
He did the crime and will go to jail - the fact that he did not know it was illegal does not enter into it.
Any restrictions to freedom of expression will always open the door to possible others, because analogical reasoning can mount arguments showing why this or that class of objects is closely similar to those for which exceptions have been made.
There is nothing so fretting and vexatious, nothing so justly TERRIBLE to tyrants, and their tools and abettors, as a FREE PRESS.

A great bargain also had been the excellent Axminster carpet which covered the floor; as, again, the arm-chair in which Bunting now sat forward, staring into the dull, small fire. In fact, that arm-chair had been an extravagance of Mrs. Bunting. She had wanted her husband to be comfortable after the day's work was done, and she had paid thirty-seven shillings for the chair.
In consequence they imposed green bans, a move which effectively prevented the execution of policy and forced a stay on proceedings.

In order to obtain "intuitive insight" into special classes of topological spaces we can proceed in several ways, only a few of which will be pursued in this chapter. For instance, we can seek to describe important topological spaces by means of enough of their properties to completely characterize them, up to homeomorphism.
We were therefore under the necessity of sending to a slop shop and each purchasing a shirt, etc.
Most of the spaces studied in Algebraic Topology, such as CW-complexes or manifolds, are Hausdorff. In contrast, finite topological spaces are rarely Hausdorff. A topological space with finitely many points, each of which is closed, must be discrete.
By the way, I apologize for posting my previous message with the Italian corrections. I meant it to send it to you by email. Lapsus muris!
If (X,𝜏) is a topological space, then a cover ℬ is open if each B∈ℬ is an open set. A topological space (X,𝜏) is compact if every open cover of X has a finite subcover.

As for “lung sick,” which is a dreadful form of pneumonia, very prevalent in this country, they [the oxen] had all been inoculated against it. This is done by cutting a slit in the tail of an ox, and binding in a piece of the diseased lung of an animal which had died of the sickness.
The estimated £3m extra cost of providing free school meals represents a little over 1% of the council's education spending. That's no small beer, but nor will it be a huge saving.
Lung sickness appeared at Toise River about this time. [ … ] I certainly think that if affected animals with lung sick cannot be slaughtered on recovery they should be branded.
“The down-troddens′ day will come soon, then you ‘gin burglars’ will have to respect the rights of the weak,” retorted the other as he moved away to the “Rib-binders” reply. “Yes, and that day, both you and I, my friend, will have to pay more for the ‘girls’ than we do today.”
No sweet scent of the exotic cheroot taints the air, there are scarcely even any smokers, and no one seems to be employing the men's room either to take on fuel or to make a brisk exchange of spermatozoa.

The City of the Sun was a model in petto for the whole earth.
‘Of course every man in the country was doing the same thing, but there was plenty of hypocrisy among the station people. The manager would refer to “combos” and “gin burglars” as though they were social outcasts. But let his wife go away for a while, or even turn her back, and he was down to the blacks′ camp in no time’ (Willey 1971:46).

When they had done, she gave Ashiepattle a whistle, and told him how to use it. If he blew into the one end of it, everything which he wished far away would be scattered to all sides, but if he blew into the other end it would all come together again; and if the whistle were lost or was taken from him, he had only to wish for it and it would come back to him. That is something like a whistle, thought Ashiepattle.

In the meantime, I had been receiving worrying reports about Nancy by mulga wire but could not find out for sure what was wrong.

If you want a more substantial meal, we recommend you start with the seasonal green salad with melon and summer herbs, or cured Parma ham slices in a roulade with walnut-oil vinaigrette.
Since hardly any Parma ham sold in England was actually sliced in the presence of the consumer as Italian law required, it would have been difficult or impossible to say of any Italian Parma ham producer that he had goodwill at the retail level in England at all.
Also, the feed that is given to the pigs destined to be Parma hams is different.

Within the tropics, lime juice and sugar were made to suffice as antiscorbutics; on reaching a higher latitude, sour krout and vinegar were substituted; the essence of malt was reserved for the passage to New Holland, and for future occasions.
We know that generally in all commonwealths, the execution of corporal punishments, was either put upon the guards, or other soldiers of the sovereign power; or given to those, in whom want of means, contempt of honour, and hardness of heart, concurred, to make them sue for such an office. But amongst the Israelites it was a positive law of God their sovereign, that he that was convicted of a capital crime, should be stoned to death by the people.
Though it is somewhat anticipating events, it is convenient to record here the result of these efforts to defeat the hitherto unconquerable enemy. Mr. Perry's report at the termination of the voyage is as follows:-- "Sour krout, mustard, vinegar, wheat, inspissated orange and lemon juices, saloup, portable soup, sugar, molasses, vegetables (at all times when they could be got) were, some in constant, others in occasional use.
But the same term, positive law, is also very often used to designate statute law or positive legislation, as distinguished from customary or unwritten law derived by the judicial application of natural reason.
A N. York paper giving the details of a riot which occurred in that city, says that "a person was struck with a brick-bat, and knocked into a wheel-barrow." We have before heard of persons being "knocked into a grease spot," and of others who had been threatened with being "knocked into a cocked hat," but this is the first time we ever heard of any one being "knocked into a wheel barrow."
There are four kinds of law: the eternal law, the natural law, the divine positive law and human positive law.

If every particle has a corresponding anti-particle, as the Standard Model asserts, the question arises, Where has all the antimatter gone? Saying that's just the way it happens to be, doesn't satisfy many scientists.

A fever, with yellow skin and black vomit in some of the cases, appeared among a party of forty men.
Black vomit is nothing but a hœmorrhage from the stomach, and may exist in any degree, from a few particles of blood mixed, as it were, into a quantity of light glairy fluid, presenting the appearance of floating dark specks or flocculi, to that of a rapid and profuse discharge of pure red blood.
On the third or fourth day, or later, the vomited matters..begin to contain blood..and they soon assume..a coffee-ground character, constituting the so-called black vomit.

Civil liberty is liberty in a state of society; that is, in a state of union with equals; consequently, limitation of self-determination is one of the necessary characteristics of civil liberty.
In the Ste Genevieve District, magnetic declination varies significantly within short distances due to iron-rich bedrock, and this might account for magnetic declinations varying from five to ten degrees east in Soulard's surveys.
There are [ … ] liberties that most of us agree should never be restricted – such as the liberty to air opinions publicly on policy issues, or the liberty to read whatever we want to read, or the liberty to worship (or not worship) according to our own belief systems. We refer to these basic liberties, the liberties to which we believe every person is entitled, as civil liberties. There is no easy step-by-step process, no simple ten-word definition, that can tell us which liberties constitute civil liberties. Personal definitions of civil liberties tend to vary depending on what sort of laws one believes should be passed.
I shall call this the standard model (SM). There is promise that this model is part of the truth.
By the 17th century several instruments had been designed to measure the magnetic declination.
Much has been said about those who go to furry and SciFi conventions and return with the "Con Crud."
This is corrected by setting the magnetic declination of the compass. This is a correction value given on all navigation maps. Once set with the magnetic declination, a compass will point to the true North Pole also known as the “Geographic North Pole." All places on Earth have a slightly different magnetic declination depending on how you line up with both poles. In an extreme case, if you stood between the two poles and faced the real North Pole, your masgnetic compass would point to the magnetic North Pole behind you—a magnetic declination of 180 degrees!

"Jones fired first and broke its leg, so he charged; Noland hit him in the back, so he about ship and wanted to make mince meat of him for his trouble; when the Doctor sent a shot through his shoulder, and he sprawled," coolly replied the boatswain's mate, as he was cutting the animal's throat, to the numerous inquiries.
They stood for the land, and as they could not fetch in before dark, they about ship, and lay "a hull, all that night," finding abundance of fish, "very large and great" …
as the sea and the wind were so dead ahead that they found they could make no way, and the boat was at times half full of water, so they about ship and ran before the wind, much to their delight, living on geese and water melons (capital things on a hot day); spent a very comfortable night before the fires, without any blankets …

While the Chippewa never waged hostility toward the United States, the feeling appears to be that they should conduct themselves as a vanquished people. Should the Chippewa fail to act vanquished and join in the mainstream of American society, they are regarded as un-American renegades deserving the epithet of "timber nigger."
But the Krater who introduces Mark to black velvet is totally human and, in his gestures, culpable.

Writer, Xavier Herbert, said that white men would refuse to work on remote stations without available Aboriginal women or ‘black velvet’.
“That's wassup, Todd! Nice too meet you mayn'e”. Antonio had no need to elevate his voice. The deep baritone carried itself over the bass line in the back ground.
"Imagine my one attempt at rational conversation last night. Asking his views on female emigration . . . ." "Perhaps the bearings of the question would hardly suit mixed company."
Black velvet — that is, the sexual abuse of Aboriginal women — had become highly topical with the publication of Coonardoo and Capricornia, and Miles’ choices in this area still seem reasonable.

even the exotic-sounding "Burdekin duck" consists of nothing more than slices of cold beef fried in batter.
[W]e have simply emanations falling back again upon their source, and as in the Kabbalah and with the Buddhist, a longing for peace in rest and eternal sleep—a re-absorption, and in fact annihilation as the end most devoutly to be wished; in fact the getting quit of ourselves as a very good riddance to bad rubbish, and which is actually the sum and substance of the pervading idea of the Buddhist religion.

As befits advocates of the “Silent Service,” the Naval Submarine League keeps a low profile.
In The Premenstrual Syndrome, Dr. Katherina Dalton summarizes many studies of behavior change that show a large portion of crimes (63 percent in an English study, 84 percent in a French) are not distributed evenly over time, but clustered in the premenstrual interval along with suicides, accidents, a decline in the quality of schoolwork, decline in intelligence test scores, visual acuity, and response speed.
In true "silent service" tradition, the Royal Canadian Navy says little about itself.
The Navy has long been known as the "silent service," and perhaps none of our naval leaders is as well known to the American public as any one of a number of generals.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) takes a lot of bashing in the media. It is true that many women become more aggressive during this period, though they are rarely out of control...Therefore, any PMS symptoms that are perceived as unstable are due to the fact that women act more like men during this phase than at any other time in their cycles.
"Aww, shucky ducky quack-quack," Imani crooned, turning to exchange a high-five with me. "We were good! No, as Nia would say, off the chain!"

There may be an actual distaste for sexual relations for a week or so prior to the period, perhaps as part of a picture of general irritability and vague feelings of discomfort of which some women complain; the name "premenstrual tension" has been applied to this.
However, the pervasive social impact of the premenstrual tension comes from psychological, behavioral change, and this is the time of month that women are likely to be admitted to psychiatric wards.
In 1931, Frank coined the term premenstrual tension, in reference to the cyclical recurrence of tension, anxiety, and suicidal ideation in 15 women during their premenstrual phase.
None of it amounts to much, particularly given that it’s all in the service of a man wanting to win a meaningless contest he doesn’t deserve to win, and the question of whether his noodlehead crew and his surprisingly competent second in command (Martin Freeman) will still respect him throughout.

Under official management schoolies week emerges almost as another kind of Gold Coast theme park; a place to go ‘wild’ safely.
Traditionally there are separate Schoolies Weeks for Queensland and New South Wales/Victorian Year 12s on the Gold Coast, so that at each one, students party with their peers.

Awareness of the fact that Yod Coalescence is somewhat stigmatized leads to hypercorrection in would-be elegant speech, with the use of [tj, dj] in place of [tʃ, dʒ] in words such as chew, June.

These infamous little green men appeared during the decisive seizures or buildings and facilities, only to disappear when associated militias and local troops arrived to consolidate the gains. In this way they provided a measure of deniability—however superficial or implausible—for Moscow.⁴⁰
Bean sprouts are a nutritious vegetarian ingredient for stir-fry.
The little green men were clearly professional soldiers by their bearing, carried Russian weapons, and wore Russian combat fatigues, but they had no identifying insignia. Vladimir Putin originally denied they were Russian soldiers; that April, he confirmed they were.
When the album succeeds, such as on the swaggering, Queen-esque “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us,” it does so on The Darkness’ own terms—that is, as a random ’80s-cliché generator. But with so many tired, lazy callbacks to its own threadbare catalog (including “Love Is Not The Answer,” a watery echo of the epic “I Believe In A Thing Called Love” from 2003’s Permission To Land), Hot Cakes marks the point where The Darkness has stopped cannibalizing the golden age of stadium rock and simply started cannibalizing itself. And, despite Hawkins’ inveterate crotch-grabbing, there was never that much meat there to begin with.
If humans are mortal, and Socrates is a human, then per alia Socrates is mortal.
[Verse] 11. Panem noſtrum ſuperſubſtātialem da nobis hodie. Giue us this day our daily bread.

In journalism, a "bulldog edition" is an edition of a daily newspaper printed early for transportation to distant points.
To be thankful for ſuch good Things as we enjoy; for our Health, and Strength, and daily Bread, and many other Bleſſings, which we are too apt not to conſider as we ought. They are all the Gifts of God, and ought to be received as ſuch.

I thinke it meete that euery chriſten man not onely know it [the Epistle to the Romans], by roate and without the boke, but alſo exerciſe himſelf therein evermore continually, as with the daily bread of the ſoule.
For he [Augustine of Hippo] calleth there the daily bread, which we continually pray for, either corporal bread and meat, which is our daily sustenance for the body, or else the visible sacrament of bread and wine, or the invisible sacraments of God's word and commandments; of the which sacraments God's word is daily heard, and the other is daily seen.
This [the Eucharist] is not a physical food but a spiritual one, the very Body and Blood of Christ, offered for them as viaticum for their earthly journey. It is the "daily bread" which the faithful should ask for and eat [every]-day, more hungry and eager for it than for earthly bread.

Back in West Berlin, Rene Block thought the term Capitalist Realism resonated strongly with other kinds of 'new realism' taking place there, in the shadow of the GDR. In 1971 he used the term again for a show of prints, but disappointedly [ … ]
Richter's concept of capitalist realism alluded to the doctrines of socialist realism east of the border. These approaches were taken further in the actions of Happening and Fluxus artists in the wake of the student movement.
"I don't think we're supposed to have sexy time at the nude beach," I snapped.
Following two earlier major Sigmar Polke shows, at Tate Liverpool in 1996 and Tate Modern in 2005, this extensive retrospective aims to show the German painter, film-maker and sculptor in full. A founder, with Gerhard Richter, of capitalist realism (a rejoinder to British and American pop art) in the 1960s), Polke went on to make an enormous variety of hallucinatory, poisonous, gorgeous and unsettling works that still reverberate with a strange, dark humour.
It captures the psychic transformation this generation has gone through: smashing through the glass at Millbank, struggling through the hard lines of the kettle, and finally piercing capitalist realisms façade: an aperture through which now flows [ … ]
One of the rules of the game is NO TABLE TALK, which means you don't want to bring moves to other players' attention that might benefit them or prevent them from making a damaging one.

With regard to The Wire, this definition has largely revolved around the capitalist realism of society, or the reality that money rules and determines everything.
In the face of the 'grand narrative' of capitalist realism, the film counters with a demystifying alternative story, erecting a protective shield to insulate the informed viewer from the shock effect of the neo-liberal narrative.
With each new stage in postmodernity, from its post-Keynesian beginning to the “end of history” period, and even today in capitalist realism, the film has received new treatment, marking the historical moment in some way. It is postmodern simulation and simulacra of itself.
Here is the first new collection of Rohmer stories in years, and they are the absolute bottom of the barrel! Detective stories, romances, war stories — everything but the "strange stories" advertised in the title.
The bottom of the barrel as far as accommodation in the Ville Nouvelle goes.
Drama is consuming. It destroys relationships. It opens a door for gossip, lying, and jealousy and is a big, fat time-sucker. The Scripture above says it all! You and I both know when the drama llama, has not just paid a visit, but also made herself right at home. It is time to evaluate your life—starting with yourself—and kick that Llama out the door.
The international building code mandates a standard minimum height for stair railings.
It was certainly true that Lewie was no ordinary llama. Other llamas didn't spend their days singing and dancing and acting! Even his parents, Mama and Papa Llama, had to admit that Lewie was a bit of a Drama Llama.
This method can be applied to Hebrew (as well as any other addition- based language). That this method is so laborious may be the reason for the invention of the Qabalistic rule Colel. By the rule of Colel, any word can be equal to any other word by plus or minus one.
"That's not the same-" "It is according to the Rule of Colel," said Byron. [ … ] "So," said the Precious Sponge, adopting Andromeda's own phrasing, “according to Agrippa and the Rule of Colel, both your friend Daisy and jessup are forms of [ … ]

The quantitative value of the BEV range anxiety is assumed to be equivalent to the cost that the BEV driver has to pay to complete the trip when the BEV is out of its electric range.
And out of the corner of his eye, he could see the fuck face of Mrs. Brown, as Steven had her bent over the bed.
There wasn′t room to throw a punch so, grabbing the man by the lapels of his coat, he gave him a Liverpool kiss, his forehead smashing into his assailant′s face connecting with the edge of his brow and the base of his nose.
Hamblyn flew into a rage and butted Alec in the face. The old Liverpool kiss!
She tries to cover her pleasure. Makes lovely noises. The interplay of expressions on her fuck face as she comes is fun for me.
Who would have thought you′d be reading about the classic Liverpool kiss in a game of squash. Poor old Anthony Hill never expected to read about it let alone be the victim of one. Pakistani squash player Mir Zaman Gul knocked Hill unconscious with his cowardly headbutt in a squash tournament.
I cannot help but follow such panopticism to its ultimate conclusion: a Nineteen Eighty-Four scenario.
The term 'nuclear family' may be found dislikable, but it is useful in avoiding the suggestion that Plato wants to abolish the family in favour of impersonal institutions of a Nineteen Eighty-Four type.
Thus arises again the specter of a Nineteen Eighty-Four, of a brave new world of robots, of a waste land that is ever more sterile, of a West that is sick from lack of mysticism.
Barnes finds an acceleration of the Orwellian trend in American life, and he cites C. Wright Mills' The Power Elite as providing "the best description of the progress made toward a Nineteen Eighty-Four social order in the United States.

Since the last update, the program freezes up after a few minutes of use.
George shook himself. He said woodenly, "If I was alone I could live so easy." His voice was monotonous, had no emphasis. "I could get a job an' not have no mess." He stopped. "Go on," said Lennie.

The calculation of these various Galois groups leads to a determination of the algebraic closures of the ground fields in the splitting fields of the corresponding vectorial polynomials.
‘I was a fairy-bread hogger at parties,’ he told me seriously, his eyes immediately changing. ‘I used to put them in my pockets or hide them wherever I could, until one day I was exposed when my host handed me my parka and four slices of fairy bread fell out. I was seven years old and up till this day if I ever see fairy bread I palpitate and realise that psychologically I will never be cured.’ I laughed at his theatrics and took the Tim Tam he offered me.
While Complex contains an algebraic closure of ℚ, it is by no means the only algebraically closed field containing an algebraic closure of ℚ. We denote by ℚalg the algebraic closure of ℚ in Complex ; this field is simply the subfield of Complex consisting of algebraic numbers. The field ℚalg is isomorphic, then, to any algebraic closure of ℚ, but even knowing that it is unique up to isomorphism very likely leaves us no more familiar with ℚalg than we were.
I notice that the rest of the party food has just about disappeared. All that is left are a few puddles of congealing tomato sauce, a couple of smashed meringues and the dried-out crusts from fifty-odd triangles of fairy bread.

There is a certain little instrument, the first of those in use with scholars, and the meanest, considering the materials of it, whether it be a joint of wheaten straw (the old Arcadian pipe) or just three inches of slender wire, or a stripped feather, or a corking pin. Farthermore, this same diminutive tool, for the posture of it, usually reclines its head on the thumb of the right hand, sustains the foremost finger upon its breast, and is itself supported by the second.

The average pram face dreams of selling their sordid story to the tabloids. From the early age of 5 when most little children dream of being a princess or an astronaut - your geordie chav Michelle is already daydreaming of getting her tits out in the news of the world for more money thatn she could earn in 20 lifetimes with her meagre talent alone.
What we've seen in the past 10 years, with the chavs and the pram faces and the Popbitch sneering (Oh hilarious! Poor person matches bag with baby!) and Little Britain and Catherine Tate and their sidesplitting yeah-but-no-but poor people, is a complete reversal of this convention, in favour of the frankly less sophisticated: "See that person who's already down? Let's go and kick him."

I asked Jim what religion he was, and he replied "bush baptist".
There is also the three-cornered jack, which runs along the ground and has somewhat fleshy green leaves. The seed vessels have four spikes like those of the iron caltrops which used to be laid down to cripple the horses of charging cavalry.
For example, three-cornered jack or double-gee (Emex australis) infests grain crops and reduces grain yield, and the spiny fruits cause severe contamination of produce such as vine fruits, peas and lupins in storage.
Annesley knew this meant that she was not to tell tales, but about what? Did Uncle Walker want his Bush Baptist religion kept a secret?

The British and Irish Isles are swinging and peaceful, pretentious and friendly, Dickensian gloomy and Carneby fresh, and so much more. There is a bit of everything — except too much sun or tastily-prepared foods. But, of course, it wouldn't be authentic without fog or greasy eggs.
From the early seventeenth century, when sustained migrations began a process of re-peopling in the emerging colonies of settlement, emigrants from the British and Irish Isles outnumbered those from any other European nation.
I hope...that you are ignorant of the whole affair, and are so bold only because you are blind...And blind enough; so that you blunder on through thick and thin, bespattering all that come in your way, according to the old, laudable maxim, Throw dirt enough, and some will stick.'
In some areas, ground squirrels may present a potential health problem because they carry ectoparasites that may transmit diseases such as bubonic plague to humans. The adult California ground squirrel has a head and body 9 to 11 inches (23-28 cm) long and a somewhat bushy tail that is about as long as the body.
Pocket gophers appear to be abundant in the APWRA on both sides of Altamont Pass Road, whereas ground squirrels appear to be abundant only on the north side.
Jortin however has pithily remarked, "It requires something of a hand even to throw dirt." The Reviewer, though no tyro, is still a bungler in that trade.

As I said earlier, the Prime Minster and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs have unmercifully labelled sections of the unemployed as dole bludgers.
People who do not support the common good, such as dole bludgers (social security cheats) fall outside the mateship fold.

The Electoral College is composed of Six Electors; Three Ecclesiatical, Mentz, Trier, Collen; and Three Secular, The Palatine, Sane, and Brandebourg
In accordance with these opinions I believe that the ancient and outmoded Electoral College system should be abolished and that the people should vote directly in all the states for President and Vice President. The Electoral College was established in the beginning of our history for the same reasons which actuated our forefathers in providing that United States senators should be elected by the legislatures rather than by the people of the respective states.

By far the more common was the low-budget "hoss opera" or "oater," ground out in relentless numbers by studios such as Universal and Republic, and designed basically for edification of the young, who took them in on Fridays and Saturdays along with the episode of a serial, a cartoon, a newsreel, and perhaps a bouncing-ball sing-along. There were, to be sure, degrees of the oater; a somewhat more subtle version, designed for adult as well as child viewing, was also made.

"Look, it's a monkey's wedding!" Ba exclaimed, using a well-known South African expression referring to rain and sunshine occurring at the same time, and admiring the eerie effect of rain falling through a burst of sunshine.
The compositional applications of granulation run from stutters (tight repetitions at rhythmic or even pitched rates; think of Mantronix's Bassline (1985) or drill and bass), to disintegration and coalescence effects.

Alan Bakke at the University of California At Davis Medical School, Karen Hopwood at the law school of the University of Texas, and Jennifer Gratz at the University of Michigan all have argued successfully in court that they were the victims of reverse discrimination because blacks were given preferential treatment in the admissions process at these schools.

For example, coral reefs are highly sensitive and vulnerable to hot temperatures, because hot temperatures cause the corals to bleach and eventually die; indeed, Cornell University marine ecologist, Drew Harvell, remarked that "In a way, corals are like the canaries in the coal mine for global warming" (Ten-Bruggencate, 2003).
Robert Bruce, whom genealogists name "Robert Bruce IV" (c 1250 - c 1304), 6th Lord of Annandale, was titled Earl of Carrick jure uxoris.
Runners who are less sensitive than I, or more macho, or simply better able to tolerate pain, might have laughed at my tiny blisters, but the fact is that these little problems are indicators of bigger problems with our technique. They are canaries in the coal mine — signs of impending back pain, knee pain, foot pain, and other big issues destined to come back to haunt you in the long run.
One of the few animals to live part of its life in water and part on land, frogs are seen by some as canaries in a coal mine — which is why the chytrid fungus has environmentalists worried.
Perhaps public assistance has little to do with obesity among the poor; instead, the poor may simply be canaries in a coal mine, their health suffering from environmental changes before others feel the impact.

The extraordinary number of these sea lawyers present, was equalled only by their rapacity. Before we began cutting-in, they had already commenced their meal. Taking advantage of a heave of the swell, a shark would wriggle up on top of the whale, and setting his wide opened mouth against the solid blubber, would bite out a piece as round as and about the size of a man's head.
On rising, and casting another hasty glance at the big head and huge back fin of my enemy, I saw that he was evidently hungry and excited, and making frantic efforts to get at me; but that, being a big shark, success in his laudable attempts was not within the resources of science -- in fact, morally and physically impossible, for there was scarcely water enough to swim a good-sized salmon. Being convinced of this highly comfortable state of things, I at once became cool and jolly; and, calling out to Frank to run to the United States Hotel, and fetch my rifle and a little bag of ammunition, which I always kept handy for chance occasions of sport, I prepared to have a little “chaff” with the “sea lawyer".

"She's a really sweet girl, kind and honest and decent, and all of her clients tell me that she fucks like a mink." "With that endorsement and the boots and the whips, maybe I should give her a try."
"...But, for general info, she'd just as gladly slide a knife in as anything else. Don't let her fool you. On the other hand, she can fuck like a mink. Have fun. I'll take Bambi any day."
She's such a holy roller that she steers every conversation around to the joys of religion.

These silent greetings were often returned in spades, accompanied by the angry rejoinder “Nigger, what the fuck you looking at?” and a pimp slap that echoed in my eyes for a week.

The intent of this rule is to discourage and make note of habitual kill stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake.

Perhaps as startling as the sheer toll was the devastation to some of the state’s well-known locales. Boardwalks along the beach in Seaside Heights, Belmar and other towns on the Jersey Shore were blown away. Amusement parks, arcades and restaurants all but vanished. Bridges to barrier islands buckled, preventing residents from even inspecting the damage to their property.
That was a real slobber knocker of a football game.

How far the very custom of hearing anything spouted withers and blows upon a fine passage, may be seen in those speeches from [Shakespeare's] Henry V. which are current in the mouths of schoolboys.
And when skipper Richie McCaw hoisted the Webb Ellis Trophy high into the night, a quarter of a century of hurt was blown away in an explosion of fireworks and cheering.

'“On my honor,” I said, “I am not whacked up on Scooby Snacks.”'
And like that little kid I spoke of in another thread, he compounds his lie's with more lies. So many that he has trouble keeping track of them all, which is why he keeps getting caught posting from the wrong smurf account.
"And then there's the question of what he's going to do when you run out of scooby snacks. You think he's tweaking now..."
Western kids often wore what they called “garbage mitts”—padded for heavy duty by city workers—instead of hockey gloves; Maritimers used their father’s work gauntlets, with heavy leather up the wrists. But the essential rules were the same everywhere: no goal-sucking, no raising, unless whoever’s younger brother was stuck in goal was also foolish enough to wear shin-pads, no long shots, no throwing your stick to stop a breakaway.
She looked like a man, like a miniature version of Buck wearing his old red toque with the ragged pompom, his garbage mitts stained with fish blood, the army green parka.

This gentleman is seen, / With a maid of seventeeen, / A-taking of his dolce far niente; / And wonders he'd achieve, / For he asks us to believe / She's his mother—and he's nearly five-and-twenty!
We should so organize our rank and mobilize our forces that our influence may not be dissipated before the advancing hosts of quackery and ignorance. This we can do effectively if only the wise and successful ones among our leaders can be induced to forgo the dolce far niente of the noontime of their lives.
Here, Tamar warns guys to come correct. "I won't be no ho / Just drop my clothes / And all the silly things that you're used to," she boldly sings.

Punishment can be positive or negative, but both decrease the chances of the behaviour recurring. Positive punishment adds something unpleasant: yelling at the cat, for example.

The article, one paper said, was not a "slam piece, another one of those shots of bad national publicity about Buffalo."
There is a widespread reluctance to speak High German in German-speaking Switzerland, and many Swiss prefer to speak even bad French or English to people who do not speak Swiss dialect.
A Solider of Fortune slam piece sought to devalue Gritz among his own jingoistic constituency.
We, the students, also were supposed to speak High German, but, like our teachers, we did so with a fairly strong Swabian accent.

"I say, Winthrop," he cried, "I've got a bone to pick with you. You've been hitting me pretty hard in that rag of yours. Do you know what a public man down in the Gulf States does with an editor who attacks him?"
Bill saw the road as an advantage for him, but he still didn't like the fact that he was seeing more and more make shift camps preparing to build permanent homes for the settling, unwanted new comers.
In a room not more than twelve feet square, were four miserable beds: the make shift, as mine host of the tape shop called it, was a singular contrivance; it was a long deal table, with a broomstick tied to each corner, rising about a foot from the surface of the table, with a cord communicating from the point of each, to form a kind of barrier for the bed, which was placed within them.
There are a few plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions in lesser populated areas, but big-city courts had few suits that did not involve medical error and "a legitimate bone to pick."
This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan.
Clean up your room.
Running a crafty biz means being a Jill of all trades, and you have to be a real self-starter (if you'll pardon the business jargon).

Gen. Wego Chiang, commander-in-chief of the Combined Service Forces, called on leaders of the free world to design an effective global strategy to safeguard world peace and to rescue the enslaved people behind the Bamboo Curtain.
As it had been for other Western reporters getting their first look behind the Bamboo Curtain, it was all a marvel for Payne. After all, here was a country that less than a quarter of a century ago had been destitute after three decades of revolutionary warfare.
… approximately 23,000 members of the L.M.S.R. staff were trained in methods approved by the Home Office for dealing with the consequences of an air raid, including the effects of poison gas and incendiary bombs.
Last year, it may be remembered, my allusions, such as they were, to the Pageant fever that obsessed the country (Pageantitis) were couched in somewhat supercilious vain.
The “pageant fever” that strikes this resort each September ...
Most contestants don't need much encouragement; once they begin to compete they catch pageant fever.

Senior Editor Leon Jaroff recently spent a weekend with a Cleveland encounter group. . . . Nearly everyone was in tears at least once during the emotion-charged weekend encounter in the basement activities room of the Methodist Church of the Redeemer in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
At times, the sessions had the air of an encounter group, with the Colombians describing their fears and frustrations, and the American journalists listening sympathetically.
This wasn’t no excursion to some all broads college with me working to get some muff diving professor and her prize pupil back with me to my room.
"I hate you," said Renee. "Let's have a hate fuck."

The chance to hate fuck the woman who tore my best friend up since birth would have been a trip.

‘We've got a file on what we call the barred window boys, Doctor. Places where you can't jump out of when the French fits take over.’
A wood stove had been fashioned from a fifty-five gallon drum, matching the design of the honey bucket in the outhouse, the fish smoker on the riverbank and, its barrell sliced diagonally and mounted on a nose wheel, the wheelbarrow in the garden.
Then, as we have reported, bogie defects came to light on the first few production "Deltics" …; these have now been remedied, but inevitably deliveries, trial running and particularly crew training were retarded as a result, so that once again ill luck has dogged the East Coast Route timetable planners.
They sat on a pebbly bank. Suddenly he caught sight of a nice flat stone, and, jumping up, began to make ducks and drakes on the water.
The children, tweens, teens, and the college market represent enormous potential for marketers, and the trend of age compression will have great impact on such selected industries as toys, apparel, cosmetics, shoes, and jewelry.
This royal Caesar doth regard no cash; Has thrown away as much in ducks and drakes As would have bought some 50,000 capons.
Some metaphors now current have been twisted out of their original meaning without those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, toe the line is sometimes written as tow the line.
"On the weekends, we get all the bridge and tunnel people who try to get in," he said., Elizabeth Fondaras, a pillar of the city’s conservative social scene, who has just told Steve Rubell she had never tried to get into Studio 54 for fear of being rejected, asked who the bridge and tunnel people were., "Those people from Queens and Staten Island and those places," he said.
He soon made ducks and drakes of what I gave him, sank lower and lower, married another woman, I believe, became an adventurer, a gambler, and a cheat.
You’d get everyone from tourists to bridge and tunnel people in the club.
And after the past few days, in which a fleet of Republicans and the president himself have utilized Jews as human shields for racist rhetoric, the Jews are tired, tired, tired of being used as defenses against naked racism, tired of being used to justify conditions at detention camps. Just plain tired.
Frito smiled diplomatically, but was suddenly stricken by a severe stomachache. His eyes began to roll and he felt very light-headed. Probably a touch of the banshee two-step, he thought as his ears started to ring like a dwarf's cash register. His tongue felt thick and his tail began to vibrate. Turning to Spam, he wished to ask him if he felt it, too. ¶ “Argle-bargle morble whoosh?” said Frito.
… and, finally, came a platoon of footmen, bearing a large green coffer full of mirrors, sponges, clothes brushes with red velvet handles, pin cushions of crimson satin, combs, nightcaps—everything that could be thought of for her comfort.

Such a strap down system reduces the cost, eliminates gimbals and associated gimbal locks, and enhances the reliability (MTBF) by having no moving elements.
Only one of the excavated graves had a grave good, a single pot (Bakr et al. 1992: 20).
In Basse–Alsace and Baden-Württemberg, perhaps the 'lump' form was favoured as it fitted better with the reduced expectation of bodily adornment in the grave, but still allowed ochre to be used as a grave good, though this may not have been the case everywhere.
At slow taxiing speed, there is insufficient rudder authority to steer the aeroplane.
He's just grumpy because he's not getting enough.
The airspeed was so low that there was insufficient elevator authority to recover from the stall.
Place the twill tape on the wrong side of the fabric so that the farthest edge is 3/4 inch (2 cm) from the cut edge of the neckline.
Many companies now offer printed twill tape for scrapbooks, altered books, and other embellishment options. These are terrific products, but you might want to create some original printed twill with your own choice of words on it. Twill tape comes in a variety of widths and can be painted or dyed to your desired color before printing.
At higher airspeeds there is sufficient aileron authority to perform extremely fast rolls.

With a ⁵/₈-inch sandpaper disk cutter, if you happen to have one in the junk drawer, or with a brass or steel tube of the same size sharpened to an edge at one end, four wheels suitable for the engine mandrel may be cut from each eraser.
There's nothing wrong with having a junk drawer. Where else can you store those odds and ends you need from time to time. But some of what ends up in the junk drawer really is junk, such as unfixable items, pens that don't work, expired coupons, and a piece to a game you sold at a garage sale five years ago.
I think of the junk drawer in my kitchen and the collection of artifacts it holds that tell many tales of family, friends, and events that form the “stuff” of my life.
Tom's little black box enables you to speak to a computer in a voice that it recognizes and obeys. It's all very "Star Trekky" and terribly exciting to see in action.

Boolean logic can be shown to be "embedded" in integer arithmetic (modulo 2) by assigning polynomials to logical connectives, like so: operatorname NOT(x)=1-x, quad operatorname AND(x,y)=xy, quad operatorname OR(x,y)=x+y-xy.
As to its efficient cause, wit owes its production to an extraordinary and peculiar temperament in the constitution of the possessor of it, in which is found a concurrence of regular and exalted ferments, and an affluence of animal spirits, refined and rectified to a great degree of purity.

. . . a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert A shape with lion body and the head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
L.A. was a magnet for lives in desperate duress. . . . The place itself provided solace and recompense. They had the comfort of other arriviste losers. They entered the L.A. spiritus mundi.

She had been through several programs, to no avail; nothing worked, she was hell-bent for leather, she was intent on hurting herself.
“Gosh!” said Marking. “Where the hell did the Japs get that? [...Was that] a Jap plane? God damn, it was fast.” And I agreed, “It was hell-bent for leather some place.”
There were some broken men among these debtors who had been in jail so long, and were so miserable and destitute of friends, so dead to the world, and utterly forgotten and uncared for, that they implored their jailers not to set them free.
Yet he was kidnapped and "taken for a ride" in the fashion which Al Capone did so much to popularize in Chicago; and one story has it that he was shot only because the rope with which he was to have been hanged did not arrive in time.
During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its happenings.
Despite the impressive scope of its activity, Ottonian Christianization rested on insecure foundations, with few churches and only a tenuous hold on most of the East Elbian and Baltic populations.

It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries and sizes — doubloons, and louis d'ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight, and I know not what besides, all shaken together at random.
In 2007, the Women’s Federation defined “leftover” women (sheng nu) as unmarried women over the age of 27 and China’s Ministry of Education added the term to its official lexicon.
The high back retracted tongue root vowel is always further back than its counterpart, rather than further forward, as is the case for the traditional lax back vowels.
Women, meanwhile, must be married by 27; after that they are branded sheng nu or “leftover women.” (This derogatory term — whose prefix “sheng” is the same word used in “leftover food” — was listed as a new word in 2007 by the Chinese Ministry of Education).
In China, the growing ranks of educated unmarried females are referred to as sheng nu, or “left—over women.”
A police-involved shooting is by definition a red ball and, by definition, a red ball requires every warm body.
Perishable freight, carloads of package freight or merchandise, oils, etc., are designated as Red Ball freight.
A special red ball card, which is a familar sight to every employe—the large red ball on the white card—is attached to every car of red ball freight, one on each side, by the agent at the red ball billing station. A special red ball envelope accompanies each car to its destination.
Bowring was a man of few words; he said, "Blaze away, my boy." And I tried to. But it was no use; I had got out of the style; my writing was too literary by a long chalk.
"My boy, remember you're taking your life in your hands," said Mrs. Morel. "NOTHING is as bad as a marriage that's a hopeless failure. Mine was bad enough, God knows, and ought to teach you something; but it might have been worse by a long chalk."

A corporation may be convicted of crimes, have its entire board of direcors be indicted for price fixing, be sued for nonpayment of state payroll taxes, have its property seized by the IRS for unpaid income taxes, and be under state and federal investigation for securities fraud, and other things, but as long as its paperwork and fees are current with the chartering agency, it will still be a corporation in good standing.
He listened to music on his media player while he worked out on the treadmill; a classic use of background fodder.
Then a man called for her, and began to make coarse jokes. But Mr. Pappleworth nodded his head in the direction of the boy, and the talk went on sotto voce.
In the refocused narrative of King Arthur's Knights, Malory's larger Arthuriad—from the sword in the stone to the final conflict between Arthur and Mordred—becomes background fodder for Gareth's foreground adventures.
And so they went ripping along, and everybody just petrified and cold to see it; and when they got to the Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made, and everybody said so.
‘Hello?’ she shouted, but still her voice came out barely louder than a sotto voce whisper.

“Butter my butt and call me a biscuit,” said Simon. He stared at Zoey, and a sheepish smile materialized on his face."
The bad points of the work are slurred over and the good ones brought out into the best light, all this through a feeling akin to that which makes it unpleasant to speak ill of one to one's face.

If not to prevent droopiness and backache, why do we underwire and wrap our lady lumps at all?
The recipes are of dishes suitable to the varying means of working men, such as cottage pie, haricot beans, scrap-bread pudding, Exeter stew, poor man's goose, and many others, combining economy and palatableness.
Boyles crouched against the wall in puris naturalibus, while Ned wrapped the magician's cape around his bare legs and flagged down the coach.
A flash bang contains no explosive, and the container is not designed to fragment.
When cold they are used for russoles, minced cutlets, croquettes, cottage pies, and souffles.

Well, one day when she got tired of my seemingly spaced-out replies she let me have it. She responded with, "Oh Mommy, I had a horrible day. First I lost my lunch pail and the teacher wouldn't let me go to the office for help. Then I got upset and jumped off the building." My response was “Oh really, darling, that is wonderful.” She started raising her voice and said “See, I knew you were not listening to me. You don't really want to know how my day was, so why do you even ask me?” That was it. I felt terrible.

Short of spraying magnums of Veuve Clicquot over backbenchers while lighting cigars with Robert Bordens, Paul and Co. announced a pre-budget teaser of how he and his pals planned to spend! spend! spend! on all sorts of crazy "please have us back" projects, things like fancy new transit system improvements, hundreds of millions of dollars for struggling farmers, and a program to curb gun violence in our fair city.
One night Bernette happened to get a load of Peggy doing a rumba with Jackie.
Well, well, J.D. Rockefeller, stick to our foolproof guide and you’ll be rolling in the Robert Bordens in no time.

Get a load of the "eyesome femininity" at the International Casino, as the Times put it.
In 2007, one year after finishing second in the Seattle International Comedy Competition (losing out to Vancouverite Damonde Tschritter, but placing ahead of American Rory Scovel, no less), Myrehaug won the Great Canadian Laugh-Off in Toronto, taking home a cool $25,000 for his efforts. That’s a lot of Sir Robert Bordens for anyone, let alone for a kid in Canadian show biz.
At twilight in the summer [ … ] the mice come out. They [ … ] eat the luncheon crumbs. Mr. Checkly, for instance, always brought his dinner in a paper parcel in his coat-tail pocket, and ate it when so disposed, sprinkling crumbs lavishly—the only lavishment of which he was ever guilty—on the floor.
I mean, who says girls can't be involved with football? Whoever said that was cray cray!
Another cray cray friend of mine, F, would do some real fucked-up shit to keep her man interested.
"Such an outcome would be unusual?" / "Exceptional. But then there are exceptions. And I'm straining every nerve to make this one!" / "And the suffering — such as today's, for instance — is unavoidable?"

The governing party receives twice as less votes here than it does on average across Russia.
For instance, one can always find a division that is envy-free and equitable: The equal division is an example.
The children also are able to construct a table to assist them in determining how many runs must be made by a truck and a trailer in order to transport 1080 tons of coal, if the truck can haul 30 tons per load and the trailer can carry twice as less coal per load.
I noticed many innuendos that the general children’s audience may not pick up; “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” with Nala and Simba? I sure did, especially when she gave Simba the “my body is ready” face towards the end of the song.
Take yesterday for instance. You can see how busy the store gets and we packers have to be ultra careful how we load the shelves and where we erect the pyramids. Two children aged about eight and ten were racing around the store playing[ … ]
Then I found Trent University. Having heard rumours that it was "the gayest school in Canada", I burned with a newfound resolve – the conviction that this was the time and place where I would finally grow to be more than a straight young white guy. Finally I would go beyond the existence of a one-dimensional character in a pre-1960's middle class novel about the racial majority. Introductory Seminar Week: my body is ready. This is it. This is when everyone lets loose. I can't let this opportunity slip away… [ … ]
I spent five hours finding a suitable present for my sister, but then I lost it and had to look all over again.
So then we tried to pinpoint it and improve it. It is the very selfsame thing, sir, we are doing now, but our superintendent is having us in now for meetings, and has in the last few days, to study results and to see where we are failing.
The news caught fire through the school, and Layla found herself — a mere first-year student at the secondary school — the center of attention and admiration.
Worse still, we’re told that gentleness is weakness, that love is just asking for grief, that generosity is fecklessness, that openness is cruisin’ for a bruisin’.
Sweetest of all, honey is chocked full of antioxidants which defend us from free radical stress from eating today's insane proliferation of dead assembly line foods. However, the less golden honey is processed and heated the more antioxidants.
[T]his was one of the anterooms off the main throneroom in which the king was accustomed to hold court with his entire retinue.
California's Acting Secretary of State . . . asked the judge in the case not to hold court on Election Day, Nov. 8, and the day before.
He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy.
The book has quite a few plot holes. For example, it's never explained why the main character came to town.
The worst part, the refugees say, is maneuvering survival in a war whose combatants are often quick-change artists, looking like a neighbor by day and a killer by night.
"Yard apes!" yelled Ramona, her name for the sort of boys who always got the best balls, who were always first on the playground, and who chased their soccer balls through other people's hopscotch games.
“Get outta my clean kitchen with those dirty feet, you yard apes!” Yard apes were unruly children.
Crude American racists often refer to blacks as "niggers," "coons," "porch monkeys," "jungle bunnies," and "yard apes."

Two or three 'hallos!' and 'now thens!' accompanied by a strong recommendation to cheese it (i. e., act of cessation), cause these trifling annoyances to cease.
Before you even start to give me some shit like that, let me tell you something, ass breath.
The defence of Mr. Conover was so prompt and admirable that the conflict was protracted until the onlookers unselfishly gave the warning cry of "Cheese it—the cop!" The principals escaped easily by running through the nearest open doors into the communicating backyards at the rear of the houses.
“Why don't you go and fuck yourself, ass breath!”

It was the Friday evening before Christmas and ASU was a ghost town. Most everyone had left for the holiday several days earlier, including all of Professor Brinkerman's students.
We here behold an impudent unlettered miscreant, wheedling himself into the acquaintance of the young and unexperienced, taking advantage of the hour of intoxication, to introduce loaded dice, and then enforcing his pretended claim by means of a loaded pistol.

This book is the result of an attempt to bring between two covers a wide region of pure mathematics.
Since the first edition was published there have been changes in the content of the pure mathematics syllabuses of the various examining boards.
[T]he crux of the debate over concepts is really to be found within discussions of the philosophy of mind.
When starting to study pure mathematics at university, students often have a refreshing sense of "beginning all over again."
Now we shall argue that science is relevant to philosophy and, in particular, to the problem of settling the disputes among the ten philosophies of mind outlined in the previous section.
Active apparel is no longer limited to track pants and basketball shorts.
The defence alleged that Benji had a pistol down inside his track pants, the weapon that Gatto finally killed him with. If the gun had been in Benji′s track pants or briefs there would be oil, dust and gunshot residue on the inside of the fabric.
While they deny the logic of history and geography, neither Gibraltar nor the Falklands will ever be truly "safe". One day these hangovers will somehow merge into their hinterlands and cease to be grit in the shoe of international relations.

A pair of grey, flannel track pants outlined the lad′s bottom very nicely indeed.
The half-dozen pieces […] were painted white and carved with festoons of flowers, birds and cupids. […] The bed was the most extravagant piece.

There are upon record a certain number of cases in which two or more urinary bladders are said to have existed. Of these some appear to me to have been cases in which the plurality was maintained merely because the organ was divided into compartments, either as a consequence of arrested development or of the formation of pouches, by the protrusion, or hernia of the mucous membrane of the organ.
The hard drive spun up. The gray screen flickered. The smiley Mac face appeared and soon I was ready to dazzle the world with The Journals Book II.
We spun up a virtual server in the cloud to handle the additional load.
Dr. Chamneys observes, that during fœtal life the mucous layer of the prepuce is always blended with the glans, and that with approaching birth the adhesion melts away. Adherence of the prepuce after birth is thus the result of arrested development. To draw back the foreskin is extremely advisable, lest the lingering adhesions undergo further thickening.

But even the more complex of Jonson’s figures tend to be definable, seen in a state of arrested development. Their speeches generate little sub-text, except as intrigue.

A caravan installed at the intersection close to the existing traffic signal box contains all the processing devices [ … ] .
Therefore, we asked the traffic department to install a vibrating traffic signal box for her to feel at each side of the street; this is being pursued at the time of this writing.
The genre of the Mary Sue similarly deals with subjectivity: in this often-derided genre, an impossibly beautiful original character, an avatar of the author herself, inserts herself into the narrative and saves the day.
Officers use only hand signals and a whistle and have no access to the traffic signal box.

Snowbird has been amending its reputation as a destination primarily for the steep-and-deep skiers and powder monkeys. Off the Baby Thunder lift in 1995, the resort has a largely protected area that has gentle slopes great for less experienced skiers.
He would always sniff for the telltale odor of kerosene, which the residents might have used for starting fires in their stoves — Edwin was death against it because of the hazard to the whole village.

Yes, getting up the mountain is more of a hassle — powder monkeys will probably yelp in frustration because of the extra minutes involved each morning. But if you want a more laid-back holiday, [ … ] you’ll love it.
Maine has only 1.3 million people but at least 25 trillion gallons of drinkable water in its lakes and aquifers. Wilfong, a former state legislator, wants to turn that resource into cold cash.

Events come to be significant as instances above all of something that can be named: generation gaps, compassion fatigues, capitalist greed, welfare cheating, road rage, and so on.
A common thread we have found with sufferers of compassion fatigue symptoms has been the progressive loss in their sense of connection and community.
Climate scientists think a La Niña event may develop this summer, meaning water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean will be cooler that normal. Although the relationship is not fully understood, historically there tends to be more hurricane activity during a La Niña event.
When people talk about “compassion fatigue” it means having difficulty tending to other peoples' needs. The following article comments on what compassion fatigue is and how to overcome it so that you are not permanently burned out.

But it would resound in the conservative media's echo chamber.
Part of Dallman's "Three Blind Mice" parody follows: / They called us donkey-braying cranks / But all they gave to win our thanks / Was bathtub gin and busted banks / For twelve long years.

To replace logarithmic tables with natural tables required some time. This seems like a modern age, yet I am not an octogenarian and I can remember the dying gasp of the logarithmic table as the standard method of computation. I have seen the desk calculator become a necessary instrument for every scientist who is doing quantitative work.
[p 49] Not so, however, is it with the modern refinements of our Canadian English. In referring to such a feat here, it would be said, not that he dived, but that he dove. [p 52] These and a thousand other examples which might be produced, fully justify the use of the term “Canadian English,” as expressive of a corrupt dialect growing up amongst our population, and gradually finding access to our periodical literature, until it threatens to produce a language as unlike our noble mother tongue as the negro patua, or the Chinese pidgeon English.

Many survivors tried to describe what they felt, but words failed them. Hard to imagine, too, the emotions of the first responders – the ambulance crews, the medics and the police – faced by ghastly mayhem. It must have felt overwhelming, but they did their jobs and doubtless saved many lives.
[V]eterans attribute a lack of money and the consequent need to rely heavily on volunteers in scheduling and the poor advance work for the candidate's appearances. Some Democratic politicians have described the problem as a case of “too many chiefs and not enough Indians.”
Boston isn’t the only city eyeing later last calls—and later business hours in general—as a means to juice local business and give downtowns a more youthful edge and vibrant, cosmopolitan feel.
I suppose only an incurable optimist would have gambled on its lasting out its full five-year term in office, for there was little to hold its super-stars together except the desire for office.

Judge Short had gone to town, and Farrar was off for a three days' cruise up the lake. I was bitterly regretting I had not gone with him when the distant notes of a coach horn reached my ear, and I descried a four-in-hand winding its way up the inn road from the direction of Mohair.
A coach horn has infinite possibilities, and the person who puts it to his mouth and puts his wisdom into it can never be guilty of a repetition, and he who instead of giving an answer gives his friend a coach horn to use as he pleases says nothing but explains everything.
Before YouTube debuted with countless videos of dudes getting kicked in the coin purse, one of the hottest things on the Internet was Laid Off, a series of animated shorts about a guy in a blue bathrobe who reflects on his joblessness.
That is partially what was so great about the brief interaction between Kevin Love and Louis Scola the other night. It was malicious, perhaps, and invites us to qualify dirty play and physical play, but it was a shade of Laimbeer – boys being boys. A week or so ago, Scola had chicken legged Love – a la every schoolyard basketball game – while attempting to save the ball from going out of bounds, only he tagged Love in his coin purse.
We crossed paths at the hospital a few months ago after his wife convinced him to get a vasectomy following the delivery of their fifth child. Knowing I'd be among the crew wielding a scalpel in the area of his love spuds allowed Bobby and me to reconnect in no time.

Sleep deprivation can lead to fatal vehicular accidents.
"Cowboys," he explained. "They cut 'em off the bulls to calm 'em down." "Hmmm, you'd think it would have the exact opposite effect," I retorted to the delight of the waitstaff. But the moment Sam saw them smile he drove the knife deep into the table and pushed the plate of deep-fried giggle berries against my chest.
Apart from making presentments in the Church courts, villagers had many informal ways of expressing their disapproval of the way a married couple comported themselves: by playing ‘rough music’ under their window, for example [ … ]
The most common form of punishment was ‘rough music’, or charivari, as it was known in southern Europe, where the villagers made a rumpus outside the house of the guilty person until he or she appeared and surrendered to the crowd, who would then subject him or her to public shame or even violent punishment.

An album of songs culled from the program has made a high-speed chase up the record charts, selling more than 3 million copies in a month.

Gary Neville, the former Manchester United and England right-back, has acknowledged that, were he starting his career today, he would probably have found himself crowded out of the Old Trafford first-team picture by overseas imports.
“If he's related to that back-stabbing, good for nothing, son of a motherless goat,” John responded with skepticism, “then I'm sure it runs in the family.”
"Son of a motherless goat!" Eugene raged with only a bit of a slur as he flailed in the muddy morass. "What the hell is this!"
"Son of a motherless goat!" Miranda Marshall hissed out through clenched teeth. "What the frigging hell is he doing here?"
However, care has to be taken to prevent oily material congealing on the walls of pipes, tanks, pumps and other equipments where there are points of restrictions as valves, bends or dead legs.
Neverthless, you sons of motherless goats, the object of the game is to move your game piece around the board, and be the first to finish.
The history of identity politics has however been marked by the increasingly strong and heard voices of, for instance, non-white and working-class women, lesbians and gay men, who do not entirely recognise themselves in these ‘As a…’ claims.
Supply and return lines should not contain dead legs.
Muzzling Kelly also elevates a semi-professional obscurantist to the status of free speech martyr, and that invites a cacophonous pile-on from the rightwing bobble heads who screech about the left’s obsession with identity politics while shovelling identity politics at their audiences.
The use of “deadended” systems, or systems with long dead legs, is unacceptable and will have a significant effect on both chemical quality and points-of-use bacteria levels
Conner's Band preceded the procession, playing the Dead March. The body was conveyed to Cypress Hill Cemetery.
It was 12:35 p.m. when the train pulled slowly out on its 21-mile journey to Windsor for the King's burial with his ancestors. As it left, the bands played their final farewell, Chopin's "Dead March."
Baiting fish is not illegal in this state, but strongly frowned upon.

I heard them on the other bank, and then saw a man on a horse crossing the river, and went to ground like a jackal.
He ran after the depredator that had been pointed out to him, and struck him with his dandy stick so smartly that he broke at once his own cane, and the assaulted man’s temper, for, turning fiercely round, the person exclaimed, “Who are you, you ruffian who dare to strike me?”
To figure a New York judge aright, and to describe his costume in its true colors, I would dress him in a bottle-green velvet shooting-coat, with a crimson cravat, a flashy diamond to his shirt, and with light gray or yellow trousers; for the “ray of glory about his head,” I would put a jaunty “wide awake;” for “the balance in his right hand,” a dandy stick; for “Mercy on his left,” should stand some dog-fancier, horse-jockey, or Ward politician.
In every passageway where the passengers’ cabins are situated, there is a steward’s station. This is a small space provided with a working table with either a fixed or a folding seat, a locker for storing cleaning materials and a slop sink (see section 184) or a slop shoot (see section 166 part I).
Iceland hoisted a high ball forward, Gomez lost his bearing and put his hands on the substitute, Hólmbert Fridjónsson, who went to ground.
The combined club system. I know years ago when I first came in the Marine Corps, I could go down to the slop shoot—that is what we referred to them as in those days; buy a drink for 10 cents; staff sergeants, 15 cents; officers, 20 cents.
Ernie Yost: We were in a forty knot gale. The ship was like a roller coaster, up one wave, down the next, and me and Wade were leaning over the railing puking, like we had spent the weekend liberty at the slop shoot.

A recent report on the Ontario government's safe schools policy in the Toronto district school board addressed the issue of racial profilings in the educational system, especially with regard to the disproportionate impact of suspensions and expulsions on racialized students.
A special unit of the TSA at Newark Liberty International Airport, trained to detect suspicious behavior, reportedly earned the nickname "Mexican hunters" for racial profiling.
What is that awful smell? P U!
Take Thatters Mark Owen and Gary Barlow - who provide the movie's theme tune Rule The World - were joined by David Walliams, Jonathan Ross, Jason Flemyng and Vinnie Jones.
Among Southern whites, the defence of slavery slid into a defence of white supremacy, since that was a useful way to unite the white population behind a coherent ideology; most Southerners did not actually own slaves, and had no necessary interest in defending that institution alone.
When the four remaining Take Thatters, sans Robbie, decided to give it a go again, no one had any idea what the public's reaction might be.
Dandelion clocks! -- Pray what are they? ... by far the best clock is made by blowing the downy seed of the dandelion.
The Magna Carta harkens back to 1215 when King John of England was forced by an assembly of barons to write down the traditional rights of the country's free persons. By so doing, he bound himself and his heirs to grant "to all freemen of our kingdom" the rights and liberties described in the great charter, or Magna Carta. Each subsequent ruler did the same. The 1297 Magna Carta represents the transition from a brokered agreement to the foundation of English law, upon which U.S. law is based.
He can't be staring at you. For a start, he's asleep.
During cataloguing for the 2007 sale, at least two Magna Cartas, previously listed as copies, were reidentified as 'originals', and no fewer than four new originals of the Forest Charter came to light.
When first connecting the service, it may be necessary to connect the Cat 5 or Cat 6 Ethernet cable directly to the computer to sign up with the ISP before inserting the router/firewall and switch between the modem and the computer(s).
… King John bowed to pressure from the rebellious barons and assented to the demands of the barons at Runnymede. For the first time in English history a king had agreed to limit his own power. As importantly, his assent was agreed in writing in the Magna Carta (which means 'Great Charter'). The physical document meant that the details could be widely distributed and remembered. The importance of the event was apparent immediately, but the long-term consequences across the centuries were unforeseen. Four hundred years later the Magna Carta was used as a crucial political weapon in the fight between Parliament and Charles I during the English Civil War.
Between 1215 and 1225 four Magna Cartas were issued. The 1215 Charter was annulled within 10 weeks. The reissues in 1216, 1217 and the final text in 1225 were all different from each other and omitted parts of or amended the original.
[R]egarding this new Ordinance relating to the trade union movement, we on the workers' side will consider it as the Magna Carta of the trade union movement and for the workers in Singapore.
It may be painful to remember that the latter day Elvis, he of the Las Vegas leer, became a besequined Jabba the Hutt, a virtual caricature of himself.
The fundamental philosophy of The Magna Carta Of Space is predicated on the principle that a reasonable man has the obligation to guard against foreseeable conflicts which a reasonable man should anticipate.
In small towns that merely want a fire station out of this Jabba the Hutt of a stimulus package, that's about as much as they can ever hope for insofar as a return on the dollars their local taxpayers send to Washington, D.C.
When we first came to California and we started putting on Westerns, there were no riders in Hollywood; they were all drugstore cowboys.
One of the most ambitious and far-reaching recent legislative initiatives is the Philippines' Magna Carta of Women, signed into law in 2009. This Magna Carta is the instrument by which the Filipino government will bring its affairs fully into compliance with CEDAW.
I was raised on Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, and as a kid I dreamed of doing the things real cowboys do—not drugstore cowboys or rodeo cowboys, but the real sweat-and-dirt variety—like roping and riding, herding cattle, and breaking horses.
Sally voted a straight ticket for her political party.
Hosing her down made her jeans cling to her labia even more, not to mention the peanuts she smuggled under her shirt when I brushed her tits. That whole bit of business made a deposit in my wank bank.
I flipped through the wank bank, finally stopping at a love scene starring me and a Bay State Games bronze-medalist pole-vaulter who was in the same Major British Writers study group as me.
Sally voted a split ticket for a Democrat and a Republican.
Finally, you should send your post to the wank bank, they'd probably classify it as a semen deposit.
Besides, Sandy includes a little cupboard love in the detail of his sentiments. Nothing can be a more undeniable proof of the truth of this statement than the trials of Mrs. K—— and Mrs. D——. In both instances the lovers were nice, attentive fatherly men.
They did too. ‘Troop the loop invades spunk dump’. ‘Interest up at wank bank’.
I stump down my field, not the lane past Mike's, and the ewes think it's feeding time. I let them bombard me, grateful for the noisy bleating of their cupboard love.
You don't owe them anything Stephen, its just cupboard love...suddenly they need you...you said it yourself, they never contacted you before.
Fog socked in O'Hare almost until noon.
Emily is slacking off since this is her last semester; she completely stopped trying to make good grades.
I read Plutarch, and Shakespeare, and Don Quixote by the sly, and supplied myself in that way with wandering thoughts, while my tutor was assuring me that "an improved man, as distinguished from an ignorant one, was a man who knew the reason why water ran downhill."
They seemed fascinated by my and Meg's absorption in the Harry Potter culture, so we told them stories of the ship wars [ … ]
Habermas may not have imagined ship wars as a context for practical discourse, but fandom is in fact an excellent space in which to engage in the forms of contestation he describes.
Of course, there are those two camps I mentioned earlier in this chapter: Team Edward and Team Jacob. Over time, Team Jacob has grown to the point where a lot of fans prefer Jacob to Edward.
Team Jacob argues that Jacob's warmth, support, and wolfy exuberance should have won Bella away from her vampire swain.
Dead tree technology doesn't saddle you with a $300 phone bill.
To Team Edward, the canon pairing with the stoic, troubled, immortal 17-year-old is unquestionable.
Although the tension between Team Edward and Team Jacob fans is usually expressed in playful banter, there is the possibility that this group conflict will erupt into hostility.
It used to be that SuSE Linux was available in personal and professional; editions, and that the Pro edition came with additional dead tree documentation.
Nobody knew, at least we never did, whether it was from just acting the jennet or out of badness that he called Babs by that name.
Paddock's motives remain unclear. Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a "lone wolf" attack. "We have no idea what his belief system was," he said.
He describes the association as a very nice informal group who periodically gets together to swap stories and share their latest elbow-grease experiences over a wobbly pop, which is Canadian for beer.
An occasional wobbly pop is one thing, but the consistent use of alcohol significantly diminishes any possible real long-term spiritual connection or spiritual awareness.
“There is the push for fag marriage in this country,” she said. “You’re a freak if you’re not fornicating by the time you’re 14.”
I hear they are letting queers get married now. They voted yes on that fag marriage idea, so you should be happy Andy!
Both bills provide for a new cold war hostile fire pay, similar to wartime combat pay.
As well as receiving the best basic pay, the Canadian soldier gets £990 a month combat pay, more than five times the British private's allowance of £180.
"Today we're all competing in an era of close brand parity, where there's very little difference in benefit performance between each brand."
This is called "brand parity," when the only real difference between products is their ads.
Though "Bother it" I may, Occasionally say,, I never use a big, big D!
Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry, ran a blistering 188.830 mph. If NASCAR is looking for proof of brand parity, these final top testing speeds suggest that parity has been achieved. . . . The Ford was Matt Kenseth's Roush Fenway Fusion, with a speed of 188.494, third was Reed Sorenson's Chip Ganassi Racing Dodge Charger at 187.915 mph, and fourth was Gordon's Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet Impala at 187.837 mph.

The newer taser delivered a more powerful electric shock to the target than the older one did.
So an hero already.
It soon became a trend on 4chan to describe someone as “an hero”—before it morphed into the verb form: “I'm going to an hero.”
Mr. Briggs recommended plated medals, on German silver, as the best.
In the clip, Dave Mustaine (our hero of the story, yet not yet "an hero") is shown recording "Through the Darkest Hour" a song about wanting to kill yourself because your bird left you.
German silver consists essentially of copper, zinc, and nickel. Various metals have been introduced under fanciful names, such as Brazilian and Nevada silver, Argentan, Potosi silver, silveroid, silvene, arguzoid, etc., but these consist of German silver with perhaps slight additions, as, for instance, of iron, manganese, lead, tin, silver, cobalt, and magnesium. German silver is noted for its whiteness, lustre, brilliance, tenacity, and toughness, and its power of resisting chemical influences.
I like how I can tell someone that I want to become an hero and they have no idea that I'm talking about suicide.
Of these, unquestionably, the most popular are the German silvers, i.e., the alloys of nickel, copper, and zinc.
German silvers are also used in ornamental hardware, costume jewelry, valves, rivets, springs, and plumbing fixtures. A typical German silver contains about 66% copper, 17% nickel, and 17% zinc.
I really really need snu snu
Am I wrong or did Rygel get some snu snu in this episode too?
Between 1865 and 1880, the supply of German silver increased greatly, leading to an abundance of items manufactured from it and a decline in its value as a rare commodity. Southern Plains metalsmiths produced horse gear, pectorals and crosses, earrings, finger rings, other jewelry, and decorative objects with German silver.
[Chill girls naturally] have tons of dude friends, they're not invested in the person they're casually sleeping with, and they like sports and beer.
If you're too gay bob and want to go play with your dolls instead, I guess you don't have to play football with us.

The others called me a gay bob when I wouldn't ditch class with them.
I got talking to an old boy in the pub, and he told me what the village used to be like in the old days.
Listen old boy, I've got some news.
The way he was so angry he would have hit me too but on the contrary he made peace with me.
Even if they managed to strike Japan, the United States or South Korea with nuclear weapons — a big if, given that they do not have a reliable delivery system — they could not save themselves from ultimate defeat. On the contrary, the use of nuclear or other terror weapons would be certain to invite overwhelming retaliation, delivering North Korea’s decision makers to a fiery oblivion.
Having two unsold houses on the market for a long time "has eaten a lot of our personal capital," Alexander said.
I found a ship's biscuit and a wizened apple in my sketch sack. They smelled of turpentine and revolted my appetite. At dusk I ate them greedily.
“But we don't have to. We can ride the circuit with you. It might take days."
Most of the advice dished out is empty calories and often presented as the gospel truth. But there is no such thing as gospel truth because everyone's situation is unique and no one investment is right unless it is considered with an investment plan.
Fantasy fiction has been categorized and described in different ways. One classification divides fantasy into two major types:¶ low fantasy, which takes place in the primary world (our world);¶ high fantasy, which takes place in alternative worlds.
HIGH FANTASY. A term used by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay on “High Fantasy and Heroic Romance" and subsequently developed by Kenneth J. Zahorski and Robert H. Boyer in an attempt to develop a terminology with which to deal with genre materials. In Zahorski and Boyer's taxonomy, high fantasy consists entirely of fiction set in second worlds, while the low fantasy with which it is immediately contrasted consists of fiction set in the primary world, into which magical objects and entities are introduced piecemeal (ie. intrusive fantasy).
Detective Peter Goodall said the source of the tablets had not been traced. "Purple heart" or drinamyl tablets, were a stimulant drug and habit-forming.
...the human potential and psychotherapy movements, as well as the more 'life-affirming' New Religious Movements and religions of the self.

I thought John would never shut up. He could talk the legs off a pot.
[ … ] Dugdale, in his Origines Judiciales, gives a long and particular account of the revelry at the Temple, on each of the twelve days of Christmas, in the year 1562. It appears from this document, that the hospitable rites of St. Stephen's Day, St. John's Day, and Twelfth Day, were ordered to be exactly alike; and as many of them are in their nature perfectly rural, there is every reason to suppose they were observed, to a certain extent, in the halls of the country gentry, and substantial yeomanry.
That order of the Church is the proper one, which disposes men to earnest meditation, which causes men to feel the weight of truth and be humbled under it; and that order is an unworthy one, which occupies the popular mind with deaneries and bishoprics, Michaelmases and Epiphanies, St. John's days and St. Stephen's days. If a preacher wish to present the doctrine of divine sovereignty to his hearers, he must let it pervade all the exercises of the Sabbath, [ … ]
Late in the morning of St. Stephen's Day, Marc mounted his horse, ready to leave Windsor, Cecily, and all of Angleterre.
We very seldom work together on The Archers, we're rarely in the same episodes, so often we're ships that pass in the night.
"Feeding the Wren" is a custom based on the legend of Saint Stephen, who was hiding in a bush and betrayed to his enemies by a wren. On Saint Stephen's Day, December 26, the young children gather together, obtain a wren, and place it in a cage on top of a bush while they go from door-to-door collecting money which will be used for charity.

The Government has said that all those sentenced to three months of internal exile and rehabilitation are ordinary criminals and that there is no political motive for the decision.
The true origins of his book of shadows have been disputed for decades. It is unlikely that such books existed in earlier times, as folk magic generally was passed orally through the generations.
Douche boats destroyed two bunkers and accumulated 30 minutes of water time.
Unless this internal shift can be made, then not only the Russians but all of humanity will continue to languish in an internal exile.
"Douche boats" had two water cannons that operated at 3,000lb per square inch, and were fed by centrifugal pumps powered by a General Motors 12V-71 diesel engine, pumping 1,000 gallons (3,785 liters) per minute through each cannon - over four tons of water a minute.

The paper presents the definition sets required for initialized fractional calculi. Two underlying bases have been used, the Riemann-Liouville based fractional calculus and the Grünwald based functional calculus (by reference).
One of the major advantages of fractional calculus is that it can be considered as a superset of integer-order calculus. Thus fractional calculus has the potential to accomplish what integer-order calculus cannot. We believe that many of the great future developments will come from the applications of fractional calculus to different fields.

That partisan rhetoric may be heated, but it's not entirely off base.
Like many thriving, young Australian execs, Simpson has to be wary of being construed a “tall poppy,” a cultural label placed on people who flaunt their success, based on the idea that a poppy taller than the others gets chopped down.
It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing-point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained.
"I say, you fellows, Johnny Crapaud says he can play cricket!” exclaimed Crow one morning. “What fun!”
Others have emphasised how it standardised and enforced social mores, cutting down ‘tall poppies’ and shirking those whose race, political beliefs, aspirations – or sexual proclivities – did not or could not bow to peer pressure.
Joan Warden of Stapleford, Cambridgeshire, when charged in 1592 with being a cunning woman, declared that 'she doth not use any charms, but that she doth use ointments and herbs to cure many diseases'.
This is not so say that any of the health professionals whom the women encountered were bullies or would have been considered by colleagues as bullies; however, they do appear to have been the agents of a bullying maternity service that disliked clients who were tall poppies and was determined to cut them down to size.

Molly worked at her picnics like she tended her roses or worked on her veggie garden, breathlessly.
One of Australia′s healthiest national traits is the Tall Poppy Syndrome, which involves taking a sceptical view of people who are rich, powerful or successful, and cutting them down to size when they appear pretentious.
Interestingly, the media in the United States are least prone to the tall poppy syndrome, which is one of the many things I admire about America.
Their left hand does the calking iron guide.
I made up my mind that a man confined to his room by inflammation of the lungs, a fellow who had only two wishes left in the world, to see a particular woman, and then to die, could neatly accomplish those two wishes at one stroke by taking this journey in the rain.
For Allan Scott, one of the ironies of owning a media outlet or being a business success is he becomes a target for other media, a potential victim of the tall poppy syndrome.
[T]he whole object of the poem is to show what infinities of spiritual good and evil a current and sordid story may contain. When once this is realised, it explains at one stroke the innumerable facts about the work.
The extracts coded as indicative of the tall poppy syndrome reflect the deeply rooted nature of this phenomenon, identified by Feather (1994a) and other researchers. The syndrome is often moderated by other Australian characteristics, and reinforces the enigma of Australian leadership.

This act [An Act anent the Aliment of Poor Prisoners 1696 (chapter 32; Parliament of Scotland)] was clearly intended to regulate the case of civil debts; but the question occurred whether by civil debts was meant debts ex contractu, or debts also ex delicto; and the Court were at first of opinion that debtors, whose debts arose ex delicto, were not entitled to the benefit of the statute. … The opinion was however given up by the Court in 1787; and debts, though arising ex delicto, were held to be civil debts in the sense of the act, and as such, did not exclude the debtor from the benefit of the statute.
A Spanish judge has charged five suspected former leaders of the armed Basque separatist movement ETA with crimes against humanity for attacks carried out by the group after 2004 which killed 12 people.
In drawing the pleadings, and framing the declaration of the cause of action against a husband, or an executor, in respect of the funeral expenses of the wife or the testator, it must be stated, in order to show a good legal ground of action ex contractu upon the record, that the things furnished were supplied at the request of the husband, or the executors, and a promise to pay for them must be alleged.
The leading distinction between obligations ex contractu and obligations quasi ex contractu is, that in the former one chooses to bind himself to another, in the latter he is placed in such circumstances that he is thereby bound to another.

Licensing laws in Australia were finally relaxed in 1967, bringing an end to the infamous six o'clock swill and encouraging people to eat out.
The six o'clock swill was the male ritual of consuming as many beers as possible in the hour before hotels and pubs closed at six o'clock. Early closing was introduced during World War One, when wartime patriotism and austerity and a general temperance mood impelled its introduction.
The diet was also changed to malted milk — from one-half to one ounce given at a feeding. The careful diet, stomach-washing with doses of one grain of cerium oxalate in one-half drachm of chalk mixture, given hourly, were ineffectual.

Another example of this method comes from my youth, when we would go to a soda fountain for a malted milk. The soda clerk′s job was to sell eggs with the malted milk. If he didn′t have the skills, he would shyly say, “You probably don′t want an egg with your malted milk do you?” The answer would be a quick no. If he knew what you know now, he would hold an egg in each hand and say, “Which do you prefer, one egg or two in your malted milk?”

When we examined the detailed history of the evolution, we fond large gaps of time in which little happened at all. Then we saw the sudden appearance of a key circuit (an enabling technology) and quick use of this for further technologies. A full adder circuit might appear after say 32,000 steps; and 2-, 3-, and 4-bit adders fairly quickly after that. In other words, we found periods of quiescence, followed by miniature "Cambrian explosions" of rapid evolution.

All puddings must be boiled in plenty of water, turned frequently, kept closely covered, and never allowed to go off the boil.
We've lived with terrorism for years, and we know you can lick it, especially if we don't overreact and make unnecessary sacrifices of liberty in the name of security - for freedom is its own best defence. Between cheese-eating surrender monkeys and fire-eating war junkies, we look for a middle way.
That is the reason for the coin. You will be able to hear it dancing about, and it will tell you if the water goes off the boil or is getting dangerously low.

Mathematical induction is often compared to the behavior of dominos. The dominos are stood up on edge close to each other in a long row. When one is knocked over, it hits the next one (analogous to n in S implies n + 1 in S), which in turn hits the next, etc. If then we hit the first (0 in S), then they will all eventually fall (S is all of ℕ). In Variation 1 above, we start by knocking over the kth domino, so that it and all subsequent ones eventually fall.
Three townhouses in Richmond, B.C., are being used to house foreign nationals pregnant with “passport babies,” and are among numerous local housing destinations for birth tourists.
The appearance and abilities of the creatures can be changed from story to story to create the standard “monster of the week” that is found in popular magical girl, sentai manga and anime.
He felt it [The X-Files] should've been more like The Fugitive, with Kolchak chasing the undead, as opposed to the monster of the week format.
Two years after the flood, my lawyer managed to hammer out a settlement with my insurance company over the damages.
The crowd was giving the bird to the warm-up act.
In New York City, property owners seeking to rebound from the storm will have to feel their way through a wilderness of new flood maps, revamped building codes and land-use ordinances, along with a host of other measures addressing the specific needs of storm-battered communities — all of which have yet to be hammered out and adopted.
Ma'am, I must protest most strongly your decision to conduct this inquest in camera.

“It’s good to get back on the ice and back to NHL habits,” Smid said. “The rink is a little bit smaller here and you’ve got to play the angles differently.”
McEnroe was broken again in the sixth game, making three uncharacteristic errors. His volleys lacked crispness. Instead of playing the angles, he was hitting them right back to Mayotte.

The priests who were, as I have said, the early students and inquirers, had worked out this astronomical side, and in that way were able to fix dates and to frame for the benefit of the populace myths and legends, which were in a certain sense explanations of the order of Nature, and a kind of "popular science."
If you take any two Manchester manufacturers, or two Birmingham manufacturers, you will find that there is that jealousy between them that if one knew that another had looked at the thing and paid no attention to it, in all probability he would not be induced to look at it.
It was published in a popular science magazine.
During the 19th century the need to make science more accessible to the public resulted in the emergence of a new type of written genre, the popular science article.
It seem’d as if hell had burst forth in a crowd, And fury permitted to range; When still and anon was re-echo’d aloud— “Come forth, thou base tyrant! thou Odo the Proud! For Morcar and Hilda, revenge!”
And as across the smoothing sea we roam, Still and anon we sang our songs of home.
In Animal Liberation, Peter Singer argues that supporters of liberation for blacks and women should support animal liberation as well and that the basic principle of equality used against racism and sexism should be extended to animals to eliminate speciesism.

By smoking twenty to thirty cigarettes a day for twenty-five years or more, a man ups his risk twenty-two times over that of a never smoker.
Line A represents an immediate and complete reversal of the effect of smoking, so that the quitter almost instantly assumes the rate of the never smoker.

In 1968 subjects classified themselves according to their present smoking behavior as either a smoker, ex-smoker or never smoker.
“Denial is not a river in Egypt,” began the first orientation lecture I ever attended in rehab, “but a lot of people build themselves palatial, twelve-room houseboats and live there for years, maybe the rest of their entire, unhappy lives.”

A select number of these robbers haunted him through his dreams, and he came to know them quite well. . . . [H]e believed in omens and thought-transference, and he deemed these dream-robbers to be the astral projection of real personages who happened at those particular moments, no matter where they were in the flesh, to be harboring designs, in the spirit, upon his wealth.
I also want to put in my two-cents-worth on the subject of fan fiction. There has been a strong trend away from fiction in fanzines of late: SPACEWARP stopped using fan fiction shortly before the end; ORB followed suit; WYLIE STAR will switch; most of the new mags are starting out with non-fiction plans. I think fiction is just as important (if not more so) in fmz as articles. Where else will embryo pro-authors get their start?
"Whether it's logic, meditation, channeling, astral projection or ghosts, all are ways of knowing," he wrote.
Laura, whose ambition is to become a professional writer, has been writing STAR TREK fiction since her early teens, and was recently nominated for a Hugo Award for fan fiction for her series ‘Federation and Empire’.

Chris Carter may bar X-Filers Mulder and Scully forever from consummating their deep bond—but it's a common fantasy in the archives of fan fiction, where familiar TV and movie characters populate digital poems, scripts, short stories—even full-length novels—that span hundreds of websites and Usenet discussion groups. Readership figures are elusive, but fanfic's America Online index page has collected a half million hits in the past year.
The acres of Harry Potter fan fiction have allowed its Millennial audience to rewrite the stories to fit their own values, easing their discomfort (while still luxuriating in the nostalgic setting of the British private-school system, an institution designed to perpetuate elitism).
Dr. Kastner prescribes the following manner of making a malt wine for the quick vinegar process [ … ]
This can be, as you note below, quite fun and entertaining, but I do think that it is very easy for people to lose track of the fact that all of these "speculations" are just fan fictions that have little to do with what Tolkien actually wrote.

fan fiction - Sometimes improperly used to mean fan science fiction, that is, ordinary fantasy published in a fan magazine. Properly, the term means fiction about fans, or something about pros, and occasionally bringing in some famous characters stf stories. It may refer to real fans by name (Tucker nudged Brackney, who was nursing a "black eye"), or may be about types, especially Joe Fann.
Unlike my experiences with many families in the West Bank, Mohammed's East Jerusalemite family seemed to avoid discussions of politics at every turn.
Triode specialized in humorous ‘fan fiction’—stories written about actual personalities in the SF field—and dates from the period in which science fiction fans did not take themselves quite so seriously as nowadays, and those who made religion from an enthusiasm were generally mocked for it.
It's a scene played out in bedrooms all over America: after minutes or hours of cuddling, the big spoon rolls off the little spoon and turns his or her back.
Keep in mind, though, boner pokes from the big spoon might get in the way of sleep. If the big spoon has a penis, that is.
"There are different kinds of cuddling positions, but I typically always start out spooning. And I am pretty small, so usually I'm the little spoon," Samuel said.

No extra ingredients to calculate, because it's a complete infant formula.
Reconstituted powdered infant formula is probably a common vehicle in transmitting Salmonella to infants, given its major role in the infant diet, but contamination of formula is more likely to occur from the preparer or preparation environment than from the manufacturing process.

Her name, from Crawford's example of it, seems to me to be written in the same chancery hand, which renders the supposed forgery a mere copy, mistaken by Welwood for the original.
But, unlike his posterity, Hercolani did not carry this sort of pleasantry too far, and his book remains a splendid specimen of the late chancery hand distinguished by decorative treatment of the ascenders and descenders and a discreet flourishing of initial and terminal letters.

When Mercy Harvey advised the nobleman to imitate her handwriting, she specified that he should write the address on the outside of the letter in "a small raggid secretary hand."
While originating at the end of the medieval period, the secretary hand was not widely employed until the early modern period, by which time it had completely displaced the earlier court hands.
Most authors, including dramatists, used both a separate secretary and an italic hand; in many cases the secretary hand was used for composing (that is, cursive or fluent) writing and italic for more formal copying.

Once you've got her "petting the kitty," watch her carefully, very carefully, not just for your own excitement—though it is, of course, very exciting—but to see how she likes to be touched.

Like vampires, the ang moh crowd comes out at night, dressed in their best shirts and armed with plenty of tax-free Singapore dollars to woo those local darlings tragically struck down by the Pinkerton syndrome.

Women sometimes tell us that part of the reason they settle for not coming during intercourse is because they're terrified their partner would be offended if they reached down to polish the pearl while they're having sex.

[page 57] The language of writers who are safely dead, and can be studied without fear of their exerting a subversive influence, bears the respectable label 'old Scots dialect'; the same tongue spoken by the living compatriots of these writers is 'bad grammar'. [ … ] This attitude is of course not new; though perhaps seldom expressed so blatantly. I call it the Pinkerton syndrome, after one of the many memorable figures in out national gallimaufray of scholarly eccentrics. John Pinkerton (1758–1826), poet, critic, historian, dramatist and Celtophobe, in 1786 produced a book, entitled Ancient Scotish Poems, never before in print: [ … ] [H]e wrote: "none can more sincerely wish a total extinction of the Scotish colloquial dialect than I do, for there are few modern Scoticisms which are not barbarisms ... Yet, I believe, no man of either kingdom would wish an extinction of the Scotish dialect in poetry." [ … ] [page 58] This is the Pinkerton syndrome: the practice of paying lip-service, and sometimes much more than this, to the Scottish culture of the past while denigrating the Scots language of the present. And it is still prevalent today.
Those articles in the tabloids stirred up a real hornets' nest.
The Carolingian minuscule, which we have already found brought to perfection at Tours and at other centres of France, was the literary hand of the Frankish Empire, and extended its influence and was gradually adopted in neighbouring countries.
James Beattie personifies the Pinkerton syndrome perfectly, for, while publishing lists of Scotticisms to be avoided, he still found time to write the occasional verse in Scots himself.
Later Merovingian hands, however, often from Italy and drawing heavily from half uncials, prefigured the later Carolingian minuscule and achieved a certain graceful legibility.
In this unreflective boomerism of American hypercapitalism, one has to hype one's project to attract venture capital.

It is generally believed that when rotating shifts are necessary the rotation should move clockwise (that is, day shift first, then swing shift, then graveyard shift, then back to day shift, and so on)
The problem is not usually associated with swing shift operation because the duties are balanced over time. When operators remain on one shift it is common for one shift to complain another has less to do.
He reports further that the natives had daggers of iron and sometimes of red copper; that the latter metal was common enough with them; ...
Not only the red copper had been hammered, but also red copper articles such as small axes made by molding were found.

And once he [Edward Burne-Jones] descended in broad daylight with a tube of ‘Mummy Brown’ in his hand, saying that he had discovered it was made of dead Pharaohs and we must bury it accordingly. So we all went out and helped—according to the rites of Mizraim and Memphis, I hope—and—to this day I could drive a spade within a foot of where that tube lies.

As mentioned earlier set theory provides a general conceptual framework for mathematics. Now, since category theory, through the notion of topos, has succeeded in axiomatising set-theory, the outcome is an entirely new categorial foundation of mathematics! The category-theorists attitude that "function" rather than "set membership" can be seen as the fundamental mathematical concept has been entirely vindicated. The pre-eminent role of set theory in contemporary mathematics is suddenly challenged. A revolution has occurred in the history of mathematical ideas (albeit a peaceful one) that will undoubtedly influence the direction of the path to the future.
There is something humiliating in the idea of getting into a one-horse booby hutch.
The operations are necessarily algebraic, because the relative magnitudes of the given quantities and the quantity sought for are unknown; and it is the essential principle of abstract algebra to furnish rules and symbols of operation which are proper for calculating independently of the knowledge of relative magnitudes.
This is neither the best nor the worst of the many abstract algebra texts written for advanced undergraduate courses. The author devotes 300 pages to a first course in abstract algebra and 200 pages to a (presumably) second course in linear algebra.

"No fear of scurvy or ship fever this voyage. What with the ship's surgeon and this other doctor, our only danger will be from drug or pill."
Classical Galois theory has developed a number of extensions and ramifications into more specific theories, which combine it with other areas of mathematics or restate its main problems in different situations. Three of the most important are geometric Galois theory, differential Galois theory, and Lie Galois theory, all of which have undergone very rapid development in recent years.
The Birdman receives straight 6-figure contracts across the board except from the East German judge, who makes him pay for his own lunch and won't even validate parking.
Ramsey theory can be loosely described as the study of structure which is preserved under finite decomposition.
The Camry interior styling and fit and finish get eights, even from the East German judge, but the Kia's pull solid nines.
We are now ready to offer a loose definition of Ramsey theory. Ramsey theory is a collection of results which, given a finite coloring of some structure, guarantee the existence of certain monochromatic configurations or substructures.
In the 35 years since the lectures which form this book were given the area of Ramsey theory has continued to undergo tremendous growth, particularly in the last decade.

Abby, let me ask you this: Is your spidey sense sure Alison was killed by a man? Your other clues were that 'he' was short, wore oversized clothing, and had dark hair. What if Alison was killed by a butch-looking female?
Urban exploration verges toward transgression without ever shattering it. Yet while urban exploration retains a purely inquisitive outlook, whereby exploration is conceived of in moralistic terms, its gradual reliance on a transgressive outlook is inevitable.
As I turn to the right to get to the Registration Desk, my spidey senses are starting to warn me. There's nothing I can see that is cause for immediate concern, but I know I've got to keep paying attention to those spidey senses. I know they've saved me in the past.

Even Albert Einstein, who first proposed it as the Cosmological Constant in his 1916 General Theory of Relativity, doubted dark energy existed. He called it his "greatest blunder". Now, after a five-year survey of nearly 240,000 galaxies reflecting eight billion years of cosmic history, a team of astrophysicists has shown the elusive force exists. The data were obtained using the Anglo-Australian Telescope, and 26 scientists contributed to the so-called WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey.

A detailed discussion of the work of J. Boes and H. Weyland on the value of sugar soap was made by F. G. as had been already pointed out in last year's report.
Sugar soap, states a writer in the "Pharmaceutical Journal," is a soap powder used by painters for washing down purposes before applying new coats of paint and varnish. It owes its name to its resemblance to Demerara sugar crystals, and is retailed in 1 lb. cartons at sixpence or less, and some of it is packed loose in casks.
Previously painted surfaces should be wiped down with sugar soap solution to remove dirt and grease, and any rough patches or holes should be filled and sanded.

Such an analysis would provide a natural way of accounting for the fact that (inter alia) transitive Objects and their ergative Subject counterparts are assigned the same theta-roles, and hence are subject to the same Selection Restrictions. For example, in (160) below:, (160) (a) John might drown the kittens/his wife/??his goldfish/?!his frying-pan/!his birth, (160) (b) The kittens/his wife/??his goldfish/?!his frying-pan/!his birth might drown, the italicised transitive Object in (160) (a) has the same theta role ( = that of THEME or PATIENT (i.e. victim!) of drown) as the italicised ergative Subject in (160) (b), and accordingly is subject to the same Selection Restrictions.

There may be additional explanations for the acceleration of structural economic change. What counts, however, is the result: Schumpeter’s ‘creative destruction’ – the displacement of old skills, trades and entire industries with their dependent localities, by more efficient new skills, trades and entire industries – is now apt to span years, often very few years, rather than generations.
If creative destruction allows fast economic growth without generating serious inflation, then it might make sense, for example, to put high values on the shares of companies that will do well in such an unusual environment.
Sex and drugs are discussed openly (one newspaper recently examined puberty by showing photographs of the development of both male and female genitalia), and you might overhear a pub chat where Jan tells all details of making whoopee.
More than the much-remarked squeeze on working-class jobs in areas of the economy such as manufacturing, [Edward] Luttwak saw an accelerated “creative destruction” affecting clerical jobs in white-collar data-heavy industries such as banking that were being disrupted by capital's “Schumpeteresque” technology-assisted modernisation as they were digitised.
Before you get all prickly on us, "just friends" doesn't necessarily mean you're making whoopee together–it simply implies that the friendship is a little, shall we say, complicated.

Under the title "Stfans -- Race of the Future", Joquel dissects the "fans are slans" theme which back in 1941 was being considered with a surprising amount of seriousness, and comes up with the obvious conclusion of phooey.
"Fans are slans" is a way of saying that we're smarter than other people. (Which is true, actually, but rather impolite to bring up in mixed company.)
Fanish culture is very tribal in nature and overly concerned with superiority as fans are slans.

The rice was then cut with the sickle and carried in on the head, then threshed with the flail, then milled and dressed, in some cases wholly by human labor, and in others by a rude machine, called a pecker mill.
the capacity of such a pecker mill was increased simply by mounting several in a row to be driven by a common shaft.
There is no Room to doubt, but the Court of France will have the Complaisance for that of Great Britain, to give the Consilium abeundi (or Warning to depart) to the Duke of Wharton, who continues upon the Coast of Normandy, meditating the Subversion of the present Government, agreeable to the Dictates of his turbulent Spirit, for which he was noted among us many Years ago, when a Student in the University of Leyden.
The first mechanical mills were harnessed to animals: the so-called pecker mill (named for the resemblance of the pestle when in action to the bill of a woodpecker) and the cog mill, a large horizontal cogwheel turned by oxen or horses.

We had a term in the military for a soldier who was not a good Battle Buddy. He was a "Blue Falcon." That rather odd name is an attempt to clean up a much more graphic term. The initials for Blue Falcon, "BF", were originally the first letters of a term I'll refrain from printing here. Let's just say that the "B" stood for "Buddy" and the "F" stood for a classic word of profanity. A BF was someone who screwed his buddies. We just called them Blue Falcons.
To them, he's a Blue Falcon, a derogatory euphemism for "buddy-fucker." Blue Falcons are great soldiers when the commander's watching. But they'll screw you in a heartbeat when nobody else is around.
The appeal from the sentence of the amtmann, lies to the senate, which also pronounces the consilium abeundi and the relegation, on the motion of the amtmann.
"American brass hats make no secret that they regard outer space as a potential theater of military operations," it said.

The shock and awe that a human being could inspire navigating a stage with such effortless yet almost supernatural command (not for nothing did legends Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly congratulate Michael [Jackson] on his dancing) vaulted Jackson and Thriller to a new level of prominence.
She received her salary de die in diem.
One expression above all others has become associated with the invasion of Iraq – "shock and awe". Developed at the Pentagon in the mid-1990s, "shock and awe" was a doctrine designed to leave the enemy so demoralised and disoriented that its will to resist crumbled. In popular parlance it has come to mean the application of overwhelming force, the effective obliteration of the enemy, and for many the term "shock and awe" has come to epitomise the crudeness of the American assault on Iraq.
That's why good strategists know when to stop shocking and awing: when to begin consolidating the benefits these strategies have provided. The classic example is Otto von Bismarck, who set new standards for shock and awe by provoking three wars—against Denmark in 1864, Austria in 1866, and France in 1870—all with a view to clearing the way for the unification of Germany.

All at once I saw a strange man coming across the diamond with a black snake whip in his hand.
I presented the mouth of the bottle in a slanting direction toward her. In an instant, she with her fingers contracted the lips of her tu quoque so as to produce a narrow curved stream, so correctly aimed that at least one-third actually entered the bottle.

The standard method of analytic continuation starts with a function f(z) defined by its power-series expansion (7.5-4) inside some circle |z-a|=r.
Since there are potentially many different ways to carry out this analytic continuation process, there are questions of ambiguity and redundancy.
Victoria Park's diminutive stands may preclude launching the ball into Row Z, but Row A would have sufficed as Hartlepool's otherwise dependable defender Chris Westwood looked to clear his lines.
Analytic continuation is a technique to extend the domain of a given analytic function. Analytic continuation often succeeds in defining further values of a function, for example, in a new region where an infinite series representation in terms of which it is initially defined becomes divergent.
Sturridge’s curling strike looked dull in comparison to this wonder throw, with the expertly folded flyer gliding from row z onto the pitch and straight into the Peruvian’s face, as the crowd at the Home of Football erupted.
Using (2.6), (2.15)-(2.18) and (2.54) in the same way as in the cases considered earlier, we get that the series (0.14) determines the analytic continuation of the Green function of the second boundary value problem into the domain K_B∩|k|<𝛽 with the property (0.23).

A guy who understands women based on movies or television will never have a chance at understanding a real woman, because we aren't like that. We aren't the "career-focused ice queen" or the "sweet helpless damsel in distress" or the "manic pixie dream girl" …. But at times, we might be some of them. Or all of them. And then we'll change again, into something much more complex. You can't pin us down.
The set of all the analytic continuations of the given element f(z) is called the complete analytic function.
Women's colleges have so much to offer it's not even funny.

To a practical statesman that will seem perhaps a counsel of perfection; and, certainly, it is a counsel that, at every stage, will encounter acute difficulties of practical operation.
Under the circumstances it seemed to be a case of ‘in for a penny, in for a pound’. If the Institute’s team were still prepared to accept the challenge, the Administration was willing to do likewise…

SQUIRREL CORN. See Dicentra.
Bulbocapnine, derived from squirrel corn, has been used to treat méniére's disease and muscular tremors, and the botanical drug complex, corydalis, which is found in the bulblets of both dutchman's breeches and squirrel corn, has been shown to be useful in treating chronic skin lesions and was once used to treat syphilis.

The ex-wife of Austrian gun maker Gaston Glock is entitled to alimony from her ex-husband regardless of her own wealth. . . . “The court . . . ruled that the alimony has to be calculated the same way as for lower incomes because the spouse that was innocently divorced is entitled to share the wealth of the other spouse.”
It appears to be a situation where the greenhouse proponents are in for a penny, in for a pound. As long as the myth needs to be kept alive, this is the inescapable conclusion.
Rule #1 of Angband is this: NEVER forget that you are a but a pathetic slave to the entity that is the Random Number God. The RNG will laugh in your face and taunt you in many ways. No matter how you may try to evade it or con it, it knows your deepest desires. You cannot hide from the RNG's mind what you are attempting to scum for. It can see your character sheet and find out what resists you are missing. It knows many insidious ways to inflict harm upon your psyche and drive you to emotional turmoil. The RNG is a marionette, and you are the slavering puppet. You will cry in relief when he gives you an artifact and then wail in despair while the RNG laughs at your pitiful failures. You CANNOT escape the horror.

So tranquil, so quiescent seems Black America in the Nixon Era that a presidential partisan could well argue that "benign neglect" has worked.

Then there was the bun-loaf, or bara brith, one of the grand institutions of Llanfairpwllycrochon. Many were the pains taken over this huge loaf—made large enough to last a week or fortnight, according to the appetites of the juvenile partakers— …
We must go all the same, Shonat anwyl (dear), or else we shall get no bara brith (currant bread) after the tea-parties. And fair play to Mrs. Jones, she does make very good bara brith, and plenty of it—I will say that for her, yes indeed!
I came to Winchester, first as a summer volunteer digger, working for £2 a week and my keep, so I think I'm quite well paid now. Then I became part of the rescue archaeology service, which was one man and a dog - I was the dog.
You eat the bara brith in thick slices, spread with butter, at tea-time. The recipe in this book calls for self-raising flour instead of yeast.
Every NSW ambulance now carries the ultimate heart-starter, the Packer Whacker, thanks to a polo field drama and one man′s generosity.
A good bara brith always calls for the fruit to be soaked overnight in strong tea. The cake improves with age, and is really good three or four days after baking. Or you can serve it warm from the oven, with lashings of salted butter and drizzled with more honey. The recipe in this book calls for self-raising flour instead of yeast.
It was no wonder the shipping insustry in Australia was flatlining under the Labor Party. You could not resuscitate the Australian shipping industry with a Packer whacker under Labor.

The most serious cold water swimmers participate in competitive ice swimming events in bodies of water less than 41 °F (5 °C), sometimes carved out of frozen rivers or lakes and part of the International Winter Swimming Association and the International Ice Swimming Association.
Systematic surveys have confirmed that obese women generally prefer thin men and take the same disdainful attitude toward fat as most people do. In their eyes, as in those of most people, the chubby chaser is a menace, not a mensch: a real man doesn't love fat.

'Okay, calm your farm and let's think this through,' Mitch said. 'Jase, go and get him a glass of water or something.'
Furthermore, we seem to derive some assistance from the special nature of acts saying something by contrast with ordinary physical actions: for with these latter even the minimum physical action, which we are seeking to detach from its consequences, is, being a bodily movement, in pari materia with at least many of its immediate and natural consequences, whereas, whatever the immediate and natural consequences of an act of saying something may be, they are at least not normally other further acts of saying something, whether more particular on the speaker's own part or even on the part of others.

Scab and black canker is rapidly destroying Salix vitellina in Nova Scotia. Ten per cent of the trees surviving from previous years were killed. The damage caused by these two diseases can not be estimated separately.
In some seasons these pests are exceedingly numerous, and in the Eastern Counties the “Black Canker,” as it is called, lays waste entire fields of turnips.
As noted, the confusion and hand wringing about who should do what mostly flows from a failure to clearly think through what an epidemic is and what will be demanded in response.

The most important point in the work of the white ant remains to be noted. I have already said that the white ant is never seen.
I admit I felt a flicker of interest, if only as an excuse to avoid ever having to attempt Downward Dog again.
The most voracious cable-muncher in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of Australia is the termite, or white ant, which eats through both lead and polythene sheathings.
When I had recovered my reason, I had the happiness of finding my brother and Delia sitting by me, and my champion kneeling before me, and pouring lavender water on my hands and face, with a look of such tender solicitude, as if his life depended upon mine.
The first thing I met was a regiment of the vilest odors that ever assaulted the human nose, and took it by storm. Cologne, with its seven and seventy evil savors, was a posy-bed to it; and the worst of this affliction was, every one had assured me that it was a chronic weakness of all hospitals, and I must bear it.

The radioactive isotope molybdenum-99 (half-life of 66 hours) decays to generate technetium-99m, which has a half-life of only six hours and is used in hospitals for medical imaging. The technetium isotope collects in various parts of the body, in particular bone. Scanners detect the radiation from the isotope to create an image, enabling diagnosis. The process uses a device that is filled with Mo-99, which decays into Tc-99m, forming a continuous supply that is ‘milked off’. The device is nicknamed the ‘moly cow’.
White ants destroy living plants by removing the epidermal layers, effectively ‘ringbarking’ the subject.

But to offend the poster child of the newly ascendant right-wing would offend Ford Nation, its multitudes signed up and ready to go, go, go and vote, vote, vote.
Emboldened, he went on to threaten Liberal Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty with Ford Nation, saying his followers could topple him if he didn’t cough up more money for the city.
Volunteers said they had distributed 1,500 t-shirts emblazoned with “Ford Nation” within the first 45 minutes.
Appropriated stories were stripped by New Ageism of their demand for sacrifice and ritual, participation, shamanic guidance requiring more than the effort needed to sit before a television, read a trash novel, or crack open a geode.

The Myth of Growth and the surfacing of the Authentic Voice, with a dash of the Impostor Syndrome thrown in for good measure, combine to deprive women from deriving satisfaction out of the boring details of technical mastery.
We believe that this study suggests an important refinement in the study of women's career aspirations, one that moves us away from stereotypes about the women or the field, and certainly from any categorical ideas about women's fear of success, impostor syndromes, or self-sabotaging behavior.

Hail Mary deal
We heard of a school that distributed timetables one week before the end of term; a boy who had been studying resistant materials throughout year 10 had food technology on his timetable.
There is some evidence that this may be the case with girls taking electronics, and systems and controls, and this is also the case in the advanced-level examinations but it does not hold for those girls choosing to study resistant materials or for those boys choosing to study textiles and food technology.

Factor analysis is a generic term that we use to describe a number of methods designed to analyze interrelationships within a set of variables or objects.
At close range, the painting [Georges Seurat's Le Cirque] is like a dot matrix of color: individual reds and blues and yellows perched side by side, giving the illusion of blending from a distance.
Hence, the idea of nonlinear factor analysis should not be treated as an extension of the basic factor analysis concept, but should be considered as an inherent effort to make factor analysis more complete and useful.
Separate exploratory factor analyses using an oblique rotation were conducted on the item sets measuring task values, task difficulty perceptions, and ability perceptions.
I feverishly wrote for Mrs. Comfort first using a notebook, then an old Mac that printed on dot matrix paper (the kind with a series of small holes used for grasping the edges as it printed onto a roll of mint green and white paper).

The linear independence of a set of vectors can be determined by calculating the Gram determinant of those vectors; if their Gram determinant is zero, then they are linearly dependent, and if their Gram determinant is non-zero, then they are linearly independent. Incidentally, the same Gram determinant can be used to calculate the hyper-volume of a hyper-parallelepiped (whose edges which "radiate" from an "origin" vertex are described by the vectors).

It'll be a long time before computers understand natural language.
He's a very good fellow, but as mad as a hatter. He's called Madman, you know. And never was such a fellow for getting all sorts of rum things about him. He tamed two snakes last half, and used to carry them about in his pocket; and I'll be bound he's got some hedgehogs and rats in his cupboard now, and no one knows what besides.
I think he’d be as mad as a hatter at your insinuation that he would invite any of his wives, if all I hear of him is true; and what I’ve heard, Wolsey has told me.
I think Adam Wayne, who is as mad as a hatter, worth more than a million of you. But you have the force, and, I admit, the common sense, and he is lost.
Truth, sir, is that which can never pass away; the Truth of Life is Good Works, which abide everlastingly.
"The church's teaching has evolved," Walsh says. "Part of indulgences is not just saying special prayers, but also doing good works."
Once Lord John passed across his newspaper, upon the margin of which he had written in pencil, "Poor devil! Mad as a hatter." No doubt it was very eccentric, and yet the performance struck me as extraordinarily clever and amusing.
In her memoirs, she wrote that she heard him speak, but his words floated away from her; it was as if her brain, already choked by the day's horrors, had issued a non serviam and refused to absorb any more.
Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a hatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method in his madness.
"You're one of the lords … and paid as like as not so that Tiberius can get a lot more of us innocent bystanders for his games!"
He had come so far, endured so much, a stunning victory of Koranic proportions merely days away but now snatched from his grasp, the crudest of fates.
If you ask me that woman's as mad as a hatter.
When I returned home, I would say, “Alex, you were good. So good that the sex I will reward you with will be of Koranic proportions.”
Here we see that both Lord TENTERDEN and Lord WYNFORD apply the test of moral turpitude to crime when considering the degree of punishment that ought to be annexed to it.
Preliminary experiments with radium of activity 1000 showed that it was very difficult to determine the magnetic deviation of the α rays.
This angular difference is the local magnetic deviation (Figure C.2). Navigation systems normally work relative to True North and therefore must remove the local magnetic deviation.
In their efforts to achieve a satisfactory definition of moral turpitude, the courts have been faced with the problem of arriving at a definition that is restrictive enough to facilitate application to a particular fact situation and yet not so broad as to distort the statutory intent. In this context moral turpitude is generally defined as a base or vile act that violates the accepted social relationship among men. This definition, however, is not completely satisfactory, and the courts generally base their decision upon the fact situation involved in the particular case. Moreover, this procedure has not been conductive to obtaining uniformity among the various jurisdictions.
Carson’s demented Obama-vilifying hot takes – Obamacare was ‘the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery’ – are too extreme to gain a serious following even among the apocalyptic rank-and-file of today’s GOP.
In characterizing moral turpitude, courts have consistently returned to themes traditionally associated with the concept of immorality. Typically included offenses are fraud, deceit, dishonesty, misrepresentation for the purpose of financial gain, and corruption, as well as offenses involving sexual misconduct and murder. In addition, many courts require a finding of knowledge or intent. However, the rationales which courts use to reach a finding of moral turpitude vary among the jurisdictions.
The manager's going to take the flak for taking our star player off the pitch.

We will know soon enough whether Cameron's was a masterly piece of nerve keeping, or the fatal blunder that broke the union of 1707. In 2012, Salmond gave some listeners the impression that devo max is what he really wanted. Whatever the outcome, Fleet Street's introspective pundits will say: "I told you so", and make dire predictions for the future, which are likely to be off the mark.

Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, while deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation [ … ]
A charge of culpable homicide found relevant against both a shopkeeper and his servant, in respect that the former had culpably entrusted his servant with the charge of drugs which were sold in the shop, and the latter had culpably dispensed to a customer such an excessive dose of tartar emetic as to cause death. Henderson (High Court), 13 June 1842; 1 Broun 360.
But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born.

Rick is very experimental and open-minded about trying new things, but Ted is a meat and potatoes kind of guy.
U.S. citizens live in an era of liberal obliviousness and media spectacles when, as the distinguished Cuban literary critic Roberto Retamar reminds us of North-South imbalances, "it is said that imperialism has ceased to exist, or when its reality is hidden behind terms such as globalization or New World Order" or masqueraded in metropolitan discourses and what he calls (with the skepticism of a Caribbean-based Caliban toward North Atlanticist Prospero's ever-white magic of techno-speak cultural domination) the "semantic carnival" of hypertextual postcoloniality.

Analytical procedures for pesticides were largely still in the "bucket chemistry" era and the methods were provided by either the chemical company or the "Official Methods" of the Association of Agricultural Chemists.
Sound-alike words are also difficult to find since they confuse the person with a limited vocabulary, as witness these errors taken from dictation: "May I have a reign check on our luncheon date?" "Please ship by partial post."

To a man, the other candidates, imagining the College expected them to glorify Uriah Heepishness, proceeded on the old trite track to decry ambition as one of the devastating forces of humanity.
One must agree that the formulas they commend to Democratic politicians as a means of distancing themselves from student unrest and so on are crude; and the Uriah Heepishness of Hubert Humphrey's American Bar Association speech (apparently written by Wattenberg) was hardly attractive.

She is the Uriah Heep of society, humbling herself before the Church and the Law, whispering sweetly her vow to honor and obey, hugging her chains as a chattel and a slave.
In the conclusion, the poet expresses his hopes that, in the future, Russia and Britain might find themselves locked in a friendly embrace, but only after all the Uriah Heeps of the British nation have been buried.
There are many obvious reasons why this would be problematic, ranging from the inadequacy of existing local roads and mass transit to handle diverted travelers to the probability that a "high-occupancy toll" lane would become an elitist "Lexus lane" barrelling people to the Hamptons in record time.
As for the Lexus lane charge, UCLA transportation guru Brian Taylor argued that toll lanes aren't a bad deal for low-income people.

Indeed, the geographical fact that economic wealth and neoliberal globalization are very geographically concentrated, with just a few cities in advanced economies being the preferred locations for the world’s major stock exchanges, for the headquarters of banks and other producer service firms, cannot be wished away through either an argumentum ad lazarum (appeal to poverty) or appreciation for the diversity of urban cultures (eg, see Myers, 2011).

Ad for advertisement is struggling hard for general recognition; some of its compounds, e. g., ad-writer, want-ad, display-ad, ad-card, ad-rate, column-ad and ad-man, are already accepted in technical terminology.
The social status of the husband devolved on his wife, as implied in Pāṇini’s sūtra (Puṁyogād ākhyāyām, IV. 1. 48), i. e. a designation derived from her husband; e. g. mahāmātrī (ministrix), wife of a mahāmātra, a high government official, and gaṇakī, wife of a gaṇaka (accountant).

The crude wool-fat, pure “de gras”, imported by the shipload to this country, principally from Marseilles, free from rosin oil, fish oil and other extraneous fats, selling at about 5 cents per pound, yields an article of as good absorbent power as lanolin, when prepared by the following process: 60 parts de gras is freed from grosser impurities by melting and straining.
The oil, when cool, solidifies, and it is sold under the name of “de gras”, or Yorkshire grease.

Thus the fraternal birth order effect is specific to male sexual orientation, and does not affect female sexual orientation.
The influence of the fraternal birth order effect is not mediated by a male growing up with older stepbrothers but is influenced by them having biological brothers (who share the same mother) regardless of whether they are raised together or apart (Bogaert, 2006).

³Lang’s Algebra [Lan02, p. 759] supports the general consensus that this was not intended as an epithet:, In the forties and fifties (mostly in the works of Cartan, Eilenberg, MacLane, and Steenrod, see [CE56]), it was realized that there was a systematic way of developing certain relations of linear algebra, depending only on fairly general constructions which were mostly arrow-theoretic, and were affectionately called abstract nonsense by Steenrod.

If V = L then the axioms of choice and the continuum hypothesis are both true, and the assertion that a measurable cardinal exists is false.
Reid wants to be top of the cops, issuing orders to Inspector Knackers and James Bonds with criminals and terrorists in his sights.
Throughout this work we adopt the Zermelo–Fraenkel (ZF) axioms of set theory with the Axiom of Choice, commonly abbreviated as ZFC. It follows from the work of Gödel and Cohen that if the ZF axioms are consistent, the Axiom of Choice can be neither proved nor disproved from the ZF axioms.
But, on this occasion, caution wisely stayed his hand and he confined himself to poisoning the Birdas coffee only, reasoning that wiping out an entire Conservative Party Association branch, while desirable from the point of view of most decent folk, might, unfortunately, have the countervailing disadvantage of attracting the attention of Inspector Knacker.
“You can call me Syd for short,” Mrs. Potts—a petite brunette in torn boyfriend jeans, vintage peep-toe wedges, and a low-cut emerald sweater—smile-nodded at Claire.
To clarify these ideas for the reader, let us show, without the axiom of choice, that a product of finitely many nonempty sets is nonempty: This is done by induction on the number n of sets. [ … ] The finite axiom of choice is not an axiom, but rather a theorem that can be proved from the other axioms. In contrast, there are weak forms of the axiom of choice that are not provable.
The ways in which advertising taps into, and draws upon, what people do anyway is exemplified in the case of boyfriend jeans.
Perhaps what this debate about whether to accept the axiom of choice indicates is that the disjunction between regularity and randomness is as fundamental to our conception of the world as that between discreteness and continuity.
The culprits responsible for these mags are the former fan and most unrelenting feudist of all times, William S Sykora; the juvenile and semi-illiterate James V Taurasi and the commercially minded fake fan, Sam Moskowitz.
Phrase coined about 1940, applied to Jack Weidenbeck, who roomed with fans and enjoyed their company but shunned all responsibility in fan doings and institutions. Generally speaking, one who hangs around fans but takes no active part in fan affairs, and may not read fantasy. Fans are, after all, at least theoretically fantasy enthusiasts; fake fans are fandom enthusiasts. They don't read prozines. (Sometimes they don't even read fanzines.) They don't remember vast numbers of insignificant details about fantasy stories and their authors illustrators and publishers. They don't collect books or proz. Fake fans do not have the haggard look that is the mark of the true fan trying to keep abreast of the latest developments in stfdom. And there are some fans who like to describe themselves as fakefans to symbolize disinterest, but their continued fanac belies them.
1955 January, Bloch, Robert, “I Was a Fake Fan for the F.B.I.!”, in Abstract‎, number 9, page 8:
The make do and mend campaign was the Board of Trade's central propaganda effort directed at housewives. It gave advice on preservation, renovation, and repair of clothing and other household goods.
For example, your potential date says she is an avid football fan (because one of your photos had you in an NFL cap). Good observation on her part spotting the cap, but you can stop the fake fan in her tracks by sacking her attempted pass at you. During preliminary discussions, bring up the topic of football and mention perhaps (keeping in line with fishing theme) that the Miami Dolphins are your favorite team, but they just haven't been the same since quarterback David Hasselhoff retired for a television career on Baywatch.

The argument that we cannot take part because of our history no longer holds true. This volte-face - a political handbrake turn, compared with the policies that Schröder's predecessor as SPD (Social Democrats) leader had stood for - was made simpler by the fact that the shift in German public opinion was as dramatic as the politicians' change of heart.
We snapped another selfie (one of the guys, Royston out of our newly acquired Singapore Zopim office, introduced the Exchange to the selfie stick, and that photo is now legendary.)
The needs of selfie takers feed into new product development such as a selfie stick that allows the ul-jang angle, a mirrorless DSLR camera with a 180-degree tilting LCD window, a motion-detecting shutter, and a camera with wireless internet for transferring images.
Can I turn now to your handbrake turn on SIPPs, where you have prohibited all investment in residential property.
But the partisan liberals in the Obama adminstration think that the rules don't apply to them. They are blind to the dragon's teeth of division and mistrust that their social justice politics sows in the body politic. They honor and celebrate the "activist," the "community organizer" and the social justice warrior, whose proud life purpose is to "raise consciousness" of injustice and marginalization.
Nevertheless, Rangers, hitherto wary of compromising any Champions League involvement, have now performed a handbrake turn and come out in support of such an arrangement.
Finally, social justice warriors always portray themselves—and seem to experience themselves—as actively suffering victims who need protection.
It's the time you realize your son's school has turned into Social Justice Warrior boot camp, where English is “Gender Studies” and History and Geography are “Global inequality and the failures of capitalism.”
It might make her look a bit ridiculous (she never criticised the delegate system when she thought she was going to win), but then Mrs Clinton seems to have what one of her supporters called the "testicular fortitude" to carry off that kind of handbrake turn.
Julian Templeman first touched fingers to keypunch in 1972, punching Fortran code onto cards at college in London. Soon after, he moved on to Macro- 11 programming on PDP-11s. This qualifies him as a Real Programmer, and until recently, he had a PDP-11 in his garage to remind him of better times.
We're making the U.S. of A. as strong as she ought to be.

I won't touch crottled greeps. Why is it everyone who's seen a crottled greep wants to watch someone else coping?
Though many have whined about blog, and indeed about crottled greeps, this won't quite do. For one thing, most places that deign to serve crottled greeps aren't classy enough to serve blog, and those that are charge an enormous corkage fee. For another, blog is too strong (in both flavor and alcohol) and covers up the delicate nuances of crottled greeps. Some people consider this a plus.
There are three zeros in “1000”.
Convened largely by black youth activists, well-attended marches against police violence in dozens of US cities are convincing displays of growing dissent – but the related acts of urgent public mourning are tools of moral indictment, not just protest. Activists are staging their own deaths because speaking out against systemic racism no longer feels like enough.
The public does not wish to be outraged in this way all the time.
Real programmers don't write applications programs; they program right down to the bare metal. Applications programming is for wimps who can't do systems programming.

Which has its pluses and minuses—it's really hard to write device drivers for bare metal in a completely type-safe language just because the levels of abstraction are wrong for talking to the bare metal.
Compared to other modern languages, C is much less forgiving, much more terse, and generally much more ill tempered. However, it is about as close to programming on the bare metal as you can get while still using a well-supported language with good library support for everything from numeric calculations to graphics.

If nothing happens when you ask nicely, raise a stink until something gets done.
Those who possess skill in handicrafts must be prepared to turn that skill into numerous channels; and in most instances men of that stamp would do well to make up their minds before starting, that, in case of need, each must turn mason, joiner, blacksmith, or painter, as circumstances require; of course it is not expected that he should be an adept in all those branches, but a handy fellow who can turn himself into a decent make-shift in such matters, will prove infinitely more useful and more welcome than one who is tied to the routine of mechanical departments.

In the old days of Magic the Gathering, the flavor text was almost all serious, sometimes even with quotes from Shakespeare or Edgar Allen Poe thrown in.
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was adopted by consensus ad referendum and recommended for approval by the Assembly later this year.
The metaphysical taxonomy of reality in magic systems occurs to varying degrees of depth, ranging from flavor text in small or large amounts (the backs of Magic: The Gathering cards exemplify short flavor text, while the codexes/codices in Dragon Age contain more elaborate philosophical ruminations) to deep integration with gameplay.

The President will speak as Gaeilge on the need for reform.
While a corrupt Chuch and untrustworthy nobles and kings scraped for power, businessmen in Italy honored pledges of businessmen from England and Scandinavia. This trust (some have called it honor among thieves) is still a hallmark of modern brokerage.
Stanley crumbled the husk of a beer nut between his thumb and middle finger.
Such people will observe honour among thieves because, within a closed group, failure to keep one's word is soon detected and leads to exclusion from the group, which conflicts with one's particular interests.
I'm sorry but I can't spell it out for you, because the whole issue is not that simple.
For instance, there's Phillip's opinion of chocolate: to him, it's just another snack—like beer nuts or a piece of fruit.
This marriage is over, do I have to spell it out?
At the end of the party, the parents of the birthday boy handed me a party bag and my prize: a bag of beer nuts. I've since wondered what kind of parent would possibly give an eight-year-old beer nuts, but whatever. It was the seventies.
Yes, Harry was all Sir Garnet on handles: butt-end loaded with lead, inlaid in all sorts of fancy-work — hearts, shamrocks, monograms and that sort of thing.
“That’s all Sir Garnet, and don’t you make no mistake. Don’t you — make no mistake.” Here Mrs. Frith gave a very loud hiccup and waved her arms and did not even say “beg pardon” for the offensive noise.
The newly renovated venue is quickly becoming an alternative outlet on Davie, distancing itself from the more commercial parties on the strip – and the basic bitches who frequent them.
Twenty or thirty years ago, it was a common practice for the weavers and spinners to be called from their proper occupations to assist in "blending," as the term is, and this without any remuneration, excepting a largess of beer to allay their thirst, and fortify them against the shoddy fever; thus these men had not such a direct interest in the work as to induce, or such an aptitude for it, as to enable them to do it well.
Andrew Marr believes that a headline with a question mark at the end is 'often a scare story, or an attempt to elevate some run-of-the-mill piece of reporting into a national controversy and, preferably, a national panic.' (Marr 2005: 253). His advice to readers is – 'If the headline asks a question, try answering "no"' (loc. cit.). This motto has since been parlayed into a 'law' – Betteridge's Law, named for Ian Betteridge after he wrote a piece for Technovia questioning the validity of a news item published under a headline that ended in a question mark[ … ].
Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it — whole-heartedly — and delete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder your darlings.

She gestured to her knitting. "I'm just running her up a little matinée jacket." .
Whatever the outcome, Fleet Street's introspective pundits will say: "I told you so", and make dire predictions for the future, which are likely to be off the mark.
I'll feel silly fronting up to George Hocken and asking him for the loan of a baby matinee jacket," I complained. "And I don't know where he lives anyway."
The Martin Report, a document containing new evidence against the Crown's case, was dismissed, and not until Azaria's missing matinee jacket was found in February 1986 was the need for a judicial inquiry established.

For this reason DNA has been termed the thread of life; the progressive elucidation of its structure and function have rightly been biology's central preoccupation since 1950.
The double helix is often described as a kind of gossamer thread of life, with genes arrayed along the thread, but in its natural habitat, the chromosome, the thread gets wrapped around pebbly little bits of protein called histone, so it's much more like small balls of twine, one after another, packed together in a bumpy amalgam.
I think free health care should also cover nearsightedness.
But the most critical tension concerns the need to balance minimal own-casualties and low collateral damage with operational effectiveness.
In 2009, the Obama Administration released guidelines on enhanced interrogation written in 2003 and 2004 by the CIA Office of Medical Services. ^((OMS).1-3(appendix F)) The OMS guidelines, even in redacted form, and opinions from the US Department of Justice's (DOJ’s) Office of Legal Counsel show that CIA physicians, psychologists, and other health care personnel had important roles in enhanced interrogation.
What is missing from this line of reasoning, however, is a frank assessment of the collateral damage caused by supply-side efforts and whether this harm outweighs the unproven positive impact of current programs, which is likely to be marginal at best.
Neoliberals readily admit that economic liberalization causes some dislocations, but they view such collateral damage as necessary for the longer term gains of increased productivity and efficiency.
The versatility and specificity of PDT regards dosing and delivery may provide a far superior treatment and management of infection than antibiotics and minimize the risk of developing resistance as well as collateral damage to host bacteria.
“So we're talking about collateral damage?” He hated the expression, because it meant someone took life very lightly, but wasn't that true? That was the nature of murder. "I doubt that poor nurse was the object of our killer's hatred. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time."

The wine was worthy to be celebrated in classic verse; none so good is, I am sure, made elsewhere in Syria ; it was liquid sunshine; and as it was manufactured by the monks, it gave us a new respect for their fastidious taste.
Financial fair play – talked about as if it is somehow nothing to do with the way the club is run, an imposition upon their work rather than a consequence of the way they work – meant that they could not spend what they do not generate.

The door of the twins' room opposite was open; a twenty-watt night-light threw a weak yellow glow into the passageway. David could hear the twins breathing in time with each other.
You see, she had already learned to color inside the lines, that is, be as quiet as she could and try to become invisible to simply blend into the wall until it was safe to come out.

True, there were a dismaying number of these in Rockland County, and each year brought more as high-rise condominiums and $2 million tract homes were being constructed along the scenic river or gouged out of rolling farmland. - "Middle Age : A Romance" (2001) by Joyce Carol Oates (Fourth Estate, paperback edition, 63)
Now individuals and teams need to be willing to colour outside the lines and not work only from inside a box, a silo, a discipline, and so on.

This is not to say, of course, that countries would be prevented from adopting common initiatives in these areas.

But if Mark recorded this prophecy post factum, he risked nothing and, as we have demonstrated above, he gained a great deal (Jesus is confirmed as a great prophet, God is understood as in control in the midst of crisis, encouragement is given to confused and frightened disciples, and the power of Rome is disarmed).

Yet the driving force of the whole process from humblest plant to possible superman is will to power, will not to be, but to be more.

That concertina was a wonder in its way. The handles that was on it first was wore out long ago, and he'd made new ones of braided rope yarn. And the bellows was patched in more places than a cranberry picker's overalls.
In the next few years, while Celtic continued with their suicidal youth policy, Stein made bricks without straw at Dunfermline.
Not long ago, it was difficult to produce photographs of tiny creatures with every part in focus. That’s because the lenses that are excellent at magnifying tiny subjects produce a narrow depth of field. A photo processing technique called focus stacking has changed that.
This is very strange. Her execution might have "stirred an unusual amount of attention because of her gender", but she got the death penalty and her two male accomplices didn't. Why didn't the pussy pass work here?

Dwarf tossing is an activity that has engendered significant opposition. This "sport" originated in 1985 when bouncers at an Australian night club decided it would be entertaining for customers to compete by seeing who could throw a dwarf the farthest.

These layers also permit visual observation of the well-known "gravitational waves," which were suggested by Helmholtz and have been investigated theoretically at some length. It is frequently suggested that these atmospheric waves may be connected with signal fading.
I work in digital all the time, but “digital makes things sound better,” said no one ever.
It is difficult to see whether a sufficient amount of energy is communicated to the sea by the air masses directly in the form of compressional waves or it is transmitted or increased by the action of gravitational waves.

In restitutive fantasy, the person imagines some goal object which is not present in the environment: the fantasy thus serves as a replacement for the absent real object. The lonely child imagines his parents when they are away from him.
The patient's aim is therefore that the analyst replace a missing part; it is not the process of self-exploration. The enactment of such a restitutive fantasy serves the defense against the depressive affect about loss: the defense against mourning.

As he does with many of his subjects, he walked straight up to this one and dropped the guillotine, likening the book under review – an authorised biography – to ‘the profile of a serial murderer’.
Such dominance by one language has implications for other, less widely spoken languages; it also produces another kind of linguistic imbalance, as foreign language learning among native English speakers is in decline, a fact that has serious implications for the future.
Another type is informational linguicism, which is connected with limited access to information caused by linguistic imbalance in a given setting.
The only reference to the national debt - the reduction of which was once a top priority for Republicans of all stripes - was a passing mention of the subject during a litany of Barack Obama's economic failings.
The aims of many feminist LP [language planning] efforts are to expose the inequalities in the linguistic portrayal of the sexes which reflect and contribute to the unequal positions of women and men in society and to take action to rectify this linguistic imbalance.

“Silk Road” was an underground website active on the Dark Web.
It is difficult to say exactly how many people are intentionally spreading HIV, but in any given week, in the San Francisco Bay Area personals section of Craigslist, it is not unusual to find at least a couple of personal ads by bug chasers or gift givers.
He says she went to the little girl's room during the show and never came back.
There was no vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystourethrography ( Figure 2(a) ).
But before we get back to business, I've got to go to the little girl's room. Nothing like sweet tea to go right through you.
Funny, I have gone as low as 16 land and my deck still had huge problems with mana glut.
And in my experience where 2 lands makes the difference between constant mana screw and constant mana glut in the deck, that compromise seems damn sweet.
When my friend Danielle (there's THAT name again) was pregnant with her oldest daughter we came across a book (of which I forget the title) which actually advocated smush names. One of the more...ahem...interesting names I remember is Shetom. It was a smush of Sheila and Thomas.

Usually, a clock waveform used in a system is a square wave. Occasionally, rectangular waveform may also be used. The time period T is the sum of the on time and off time.
When the off time was 0 s, namely, the illumination is continuous, a black film was deposited.
It is suggested that Rule VIII (c) requires that the drivers be on the track 5 minutes before off time, not post time, and that since off time can not be known until the race actually starts, the rule is meaningless.
We do not want to minimize the painful off time feelings experienced by the younger men we interviewed.
Though sexual myths project the image of the black male "pussy bandit," the "player" as the erotic hero leading this life of endless pleasure, behind the mask is the reality of suffering.
That is why the break fast at the end of Yom Kippur often has an air of achievement.
Glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid were significantly increased in children with acetaminophen overdose compared to healthy controls.
It is perhaps easiest to see the superimposition of vocal fry, so we will begin with this behavior.

On May 6 the same year they held the first break dance competition in Beijing. Many parents have changed their attitude towards the youngsters doing break dances.
They grinned at each other and hit their blues and twos.
When I was invited to lead the bride in the traditional dance I, for some reason, thought it would be amusing to do a break dance in the middle of the floor.

But in 1992, Bissell still maintained, "Lumumba and Sukarno were two of the worst people in public life I've ever heard of. They were mad dogs. Castro I saw not as a mad dog but as a purposeful antagonist. I believed that they were dangerous to the United States. There was a widespread belief that societies in the noncommunist world were exceedingly fragile, susceptible to being destroyed by these demagogues."
We went gladly, without fear or holding back. We were resolute that those mad dogs should not get through. 'They shall not pass'! And they did not pass!" "Glorious!" cried the priest, drinking the story in.
"You steer clear of that rascally teacher and young Merwell," advised Dave's father. "They are a bad lot." "I'll steer clear if I can," answered Dave.
But unless you are also philosophical and like to listen to a lot of dialogue—or, worse yet, read reams of subtitles—I think you'd be wise to steer clear.
If you think you can steer clear of government surveillance by staying off-line, think again.
I see our asses in a sling if we get caught, that's what I see.
Dempsey briefed senior HUD officials on federal ethics rules in early 1981, he said, "and most of those who later got their ass in a sling sat there and ignored it."

By referring to the charts for both January and July, it will be seen that a permanent area of low pressure exists to the south of us, but that whereas the positions of the anti-cyclones during January cause the storms formed in this area to have but little effect on the [Cape] Colony, their positions during July being much farther north, exposes the whole Colony to the full force of the South Sea cyclones.
If you feel it is the duty of others to refute the claim, and not of yourself to support it, then how about refuting the existence of invisible pink unicorns?
Kafka's illnesses are more existential than physical; they are like Kierkegaard's "sickness unto death."
Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of great spiritual power. We know this because they are capable of being invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them.
These films . . . are evidence of a deep cultural malaise. The need to make them and the desire to consume them are symptoms of a contemporary sickness unto death.
[O]ur "high" or "academic" or "avant-garde" culture is in a state of crisis. This crisis is not a healthy one, but a sickness unto death, a decadence that threatens to destroy our society.
From a quite opposite perspective, an interesting departure of the 1990s (largely on the internet, and still flourishing) is the cult of the Invisible Pink Unicorn, which is at least in part a philosophical tool for examining the nature of religious faith from a skeptical point of view.
We talk a lot about being "a nation of laws," but some of the laws found on the books of states, counties and municipalities are a bit much.

The Name of any Thing or Being, or any Word in English, which will admit of a, an or the, before it, so as without any other Word to make Sense, is a Noun Substantive; if it is common to all of that Kind, it is a Noun Substantive Common; as Homo a Man, Angelus an Angel; but if it is proper to one, or to some of that Kind, it is a Noun Substantive proper, as Joannes, Gabriel.

While Iran and Mesopotamia therefore enjoyed relative security in the third century a.d., the internal cohesion of the Roman state showed signs of serious disrepair. The civil war between 193 and 197 a.d., which brought the first "barracks emperor" to power, was a mere prelude to the distresses of the years 235 to 285 a.d., when recurrent struggles between rival candidates for the imperial throne opened the gates to barbarian invasion accompanied by pestilential disease of unusual severity.

She and the kids moved to Brentwood, and I continued to see the kids as much as being a weekend dad allowed.
My dad promised that he would be more than just a “weekend dad” who fulfilled his obligatory parental duties with limited visits.

[S]he [Edwina, mother of Tennessee Williams] was indeed Amanda [Wingfield, character in Williams' play The Glass Menagerie] in the flesh: a doughty chatterbox from Ohio who adopted the manner of a Southern belle and eschewed both drink and sex to the greatest extent possible.

Depth psychology now probably has more influence on the U.S. at large through business and advertising than through clinics or mental-health programs.
[A] nucleus of thinkers at Columbia . . . formed a loose federation of like minds. . . . Most were influenced by European social science, in particular by psychoanalysis and depth psychology, which offered more fruitful diagnostic methods than the tired formulas of Marxism and the class struggle.
The importance of detecting Cosmic Neutrino Background is that, although detailed studies of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and Cosmic Microwave Background give information of the early Universe at ~a few minutes old and ~300 k years old, respectively, observation of Cosmic Neutrino Background allows us to study the early Universe at ~1 s old.
Information about earlier times can, in principle, be derived from the Cosmic Neutrino Background (relic neutrinos). The neutrinos decouple already about 1 second after the Big Bang at a temperature of around 1 MeV or 10^{10} Kelvin. Today their temperature is about 1.95 Kelvin. Registration of these neutrinos is an extremely challenging experimental problem, which can hardly be solved with the present technologies
Ground-based observatories have been collecting 0.2 - 20 TeV gamma rays from blazars for about twenty years. These gamma rays can experience absorption along the line of sight due to interactions with the extragalactic background light (EBL). In this paper, we show that the gamma-ray optical depth can be reduced to the convolution product of an EBL kernel with the EBL intensity, assuming a particular form for the EBL evolution
The latter statute [Statute of Praemunire (16 Ric. II, chapter 5)] stated that any person who appealed to a court outside England, if presented with a writ of praemunire facias, was required to answer the resulting charges of contempt within two months or face penalties of outlawry and forfeiture of all lands and goods. The writ of praemunire facias had been available for some years. What the new statute did was to ensure that people making an appeal to a foreign court faced serious penalties if they ignored a writ of praemunire facias.

For the Imhoffs, moreover, as for most northern collectors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Dürer holds pride of place, being represented by a complete collection of his prints and probably the largest group of his drawings gathered anywhere.
We never heard about those changes coming, and were told everything would be staying the same. Typical mushroom syndrome from management again.
Agnew's triadic postulate is not in itself very controversial, but there have been sharp disagreements over which ingredient(s) of place should be given pride of place.
Europe at the start of the 1990s was abuzz with organizational concepts and visions, and among these none had as much pride of place as the notion of "confederation."
If the slogan is somewhat “tongue in chic,” to use Lehrman's phrase, it's not far off base.
For a touch of tongue in chic, Naco-Paris, an indie street designer, has been described by the French press as fashion's Robin Hood with his minimalism and punk attitude that often denounces the consumption craze promoted by the luxury industry.
The participant shares pride of place with the events themselves in our minds as we read Virgil's text.
But I had no guess of it then as I sat writing by the fireside, in what seemed the spring-tides of a somewhat pedestrian inspiration; nor yet day by day, after lunch, as I read aloud my morning's work to the family. It seemed to me original as sin; it seemed to belong to me like my right eye.
The Yankee has much pride of place, believing himself the citizen of no mean city. In the heart of the Commonwealth this pride is conspicuous, and Mr. Hoar was proud of the city and county of Worcester.
It's smaller than I'd expected, and without much pride of place.

[S]ince at least the 1960s a common designation for that style has been "logical punctuation." ... [T]he vast majority of the legion of logical punctuators are not consciously rejecting illogical American style, or consciously imitating the British. ... [D]espite the love it gets from the masses, logical punctuation isn't likely to break through to the rule-keepers any time soon.
The debate about "logical punctuation" suggests two things. First, there is nothing very logical about it. As with so many aspects of language, what you use tends to be the result of a battle between what you were taught, and what you like the look of. Second, British and American English have more in common than people sometimes think.

We might examine first the special nature of restoration or preservation issues as they relate to charismatic megafauna, the high-profile species of which wolves are a classic example.

Singapore is free of corruption as any place on earth. (Even small-scale bribery attempts lead to immediate arrest.) Ironically, this has surfaced as a disadvantage for Singaporeans conducting business in other countries - where contacts aren’t always considered binding, bureaucratic inefficiency can make a mockery of time tables, infrastructures can be unreliable, “quality” may be seen as a relative term and “tea money” (known as “coffee money” during Singapore’s British colonial days) is a prerequisite to getting anything done.
If you have ever paid or are thinking of paying ‘Coffee Money’ when stopped for traffic or other offences, don’t ever do this again.
On the other hand, a man with the external earmarks of the old American stock is accepted uncritically as a one hundred percent American. […] For the average Klansman, apparently, one hundred percent Americanism is often identified with the crude and unreasoned emotional enthusiasms that are excited by external symbols such as the flag, the soldier's uniform, or the words of the Declaration of Independence.
McGill University is a well-known Canadian postsecondary school.
His experiences debating made him a more articulate communicator, not least because the topics were often controversial.
Then we would start a massive international ad campaign to lure tourists and rich old settlers. Something like . . . ‘Come and bury yourself in the map of Tassie.’ Could just work.
English fever = the overwhelming desire to (1) acquire English, (2) ensure that one's children acquire English, as a second or foreign language.
The relentless competition for learning English showed the tip of its monstrous image in the summer of 1991, when the government announced the plan to introduce English to elementary school grades by 1995. The news brought a huge typhoon of English, which swept the whole country into "English fever."
If this were elsewhere in Australia, say the Apple Isle, my start would probably have come in the form of a kitsch pair of undies tastelessly plastered with an invitation to view my map of Tassie.
Correspondingly, a wave of “English fever” swept the nation, and English training has become a huge industry.

There is a phenomenon in stock market investment known as "seasonality." In Canada we sometimes summarize it with the epithet "Buy when it snows, sell when it goes."
According to Carlo R. Besenius, CEO of Creative Global Investments in Luxembourg, the trade, known as "buy when it snows, sell when it goes," was profitable in 53 of the past 61 periods. In a recent note, he pointed out that Munich, Geneva, Luxembourg, and Calgary had their first snowfall on Sunday, Oct. 28. He credits annual recurring events such as transactions for tax purposes and the holidays, among others.
Particularly good cooking techniques for the Oyster mushroom are stir or deep frying, sautéing, and braising. Some folks enjoy eating them raw in salads, but we do not recommend this. Oyster mushrooms are complemented by onions, butter, mild cheeses, fish, chicken, cream sauces, and gentle herbs.
Oyster Mushrooms always grow on wood—but sometimes above roots or beside stumps, which creates the illusion they're growing from soil, which they're not.
Harvesting wild oyster mushrooms has always been a favorite fall gathering activity for me as a Michigan outdoorsman.
Nobody worried that it would rain on the vegetable briyani or the muah chee man.
The programme accurately sends up the British Civil Service system at Whitehall.
Since we were already filled to the gills, we could only meekly manage a helping of muah chee, squares of glutinous rice paste lightly dusted with ground peanuts and black sesame seeds.
A retired British civil servant and an Oxford graduate at that, vigorously advocates that Singaporeans should speak Singapore English.

I have always been of the opinion that anybody, particularly expatriates, who subscribe to the “Singapore English” idea is a saboteur, and should not be entrusted with the teaching of the language to our students.
As many as a quarter of the nation's commercially kept bees went missing last year, presumed dead, in a phenomenon now called colony collapse disorder.
More recently, in the past five years, there has been the effort to collect, computerise, and analyse a million-word corpus of both written and spoken Singapore English.
In the following paragraphs the term Singapore Colloquial English refers to the very informal variety used in some situations by native or proficient speakers of Singapore English, who choose this variety as an alternative to Standard English and often mix it with Standard English (or with other languages).
Interaction among multiple pathogens and parasites is the proposed cause for Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a syndrome characterized by worker bees abandoning the hive. Here we provide the first documentation that the phorid fly Apocephalus borealis, previously known to parasitize bumble bees, also infects and eventually kills honey bees and may pose an emerging threat to North American apiculture.
As the number of native speakers of Singapore English and Mandarin increases, the colonial-era ideology of English vis-à-vis the languages of the immigrants needs to be re-examined.

Ontario may soon be classed as a "have-not" province and receive equalization payments for the first time in its history.
Six “have-not” provinces are splitting $15.4 billion in equalization payments in 2012-13.

"Now," Mr. Gaunt said. "Let me give you a few directions, Ace. And remember what I said: I want you back by midnight. If you're not back by midnight, I will be unhappy. When I'm unhappy, I sometimes lose my temper. You wouldn't want to be around when that happens.", "Do you Hulk out?" Ace asked jestingly.
Our media is so punch-drunk from the 16-month Hindenburg explosion of Trump’s candidacy, they no longer notice how awful he is unless he hulks out on stage or grabs the foundational principles of our republic by the pussy.
Good Lord, how we agonized over spending so much time in the briefing scene in this ep. Ironically, this episode arrived just as we were collating feedback off the 'net and found, stunningly, you people love the briefing scenes. For we writers, it was always X pages of pipe we tried to make as entertaining as possible and move past to get into the plot. For the audience, watching competent people banter and plan was a big part of the appeal. "Competence porn" as we started calling it.
“[C]ompetence porn,” has been thrown around by many critics in describing The Martian. John Rogers, creator of erstwhile TNT drama Leverage, coined the term in 2009, when he and his writers realized that viewers were addicted to the show’s pipe-laying, jargon-laden briefing scenes. “Competence porn” is a truly excellent phrase for an old phenomenon; the frisson of watching smart people tackle tasks with freaky aptitude dates as far back as Robinson Crusoe.

I am happy to note that the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) is going to promote informal volunteerism through the Vertical Kampong initiative.

From the river Danais (Tanais) westward to the river Rhine, which takes its rise in the Alps, whence it runs northward to the arm of the ocean that surrounds Britannia, and south to the river Donua or Danube, whose source is near that of the Rhine, and runs eastward in the north of Greece, till it empties itself into the Wendel sea, or Mediterranean, and north even unto the ocean, which men call Cwen sea (or the White sea). Within this are many nations, and the whole of this tract of country is called Germany.

Hey! I was led to believe that Fosters was crap, and that the various Australian microbrews were the way to go. If that's the case, then wouldn't offering a Fosters to a visitor be an insult? Another way of saying, "Your palette^([sic]) probably cannot descriminate between a quality beer and kangaroo piss, so there's no need to waste the good stuff on you. Here, have a Fosters." :)
Some of that kampong spirit still survives in the clean, orderly HDB estates today. But for the most part, Malay-Muslim families depend on their own immediate members.
Attempts to re-ignite the kampong spirit of community were evident at every turn.
Hey Billy, stop drinking kangaroo piss for breakfast and wake up.

A new generation is battling through, but there are still too many Sir Bufton Tuftons at the core of the Party organisation.
Many people see it is as the sole preserve of the Bufton Tuftons who sit in their gentleman's clubs complaining about the ills of the modern world while chomping away on a pheasant, mallard duck or partridge.
Once, after a spammer trolled Nanae, accusing antis of having no life, Mad Pierre sarcastically responded that the spammer was correct. ¶ “Damn, you’ve got us bang to rights. We have no lives. None. At all.”
He just replaced the Bufton Tuftons with a bunch of people whose only qualification is a hatred of meat and a chip on the shoulder.

Wyatt (Kurt Russell): Go ahead. Skin it. Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens. . . . I'm getting tired of your gas. Jerk that pistol and go to work.
The Kallang Wave is not so much about the National Stadium as it is about the symbolism of local football's diminishing importance to a populace seemingly obsessed with material success.
I triple dog dare you to jump.
By classifying van Niekerk's food on a par with scrag ends of cheese and half-tins of sardines, we managed to eat a surprising number of omelets of a surprising number of varieties: caviare omelet, grouse omelet, roll-mop omelet, almost anything that could be chopped up and served between folds of egg was added to the list .
Perhaps they did not get rid of scrag ends, the damaged notes that are kept in bank tills.

Sometimes people aren't available for a rousing night of "Netflix and chill." - Can't change someone or fix them. People are who they are, especially as they get older.
Rachel Finch: But in this age of "Netflix and chill", it is no time to be looking for someone decent.
If you haven't been living under a rock, you're well aware of "Netflix and Chill," which is the new hang out method. Contrary to prior belief, if invited to Netflix and chill, don't expect to spend a couple hours watching Netflix. It's actually the new version of "let's hook up."
Nowadays, Grammer and his wife spend their days “Netflix and chilling”—with an emphasis on the “chilling.”

Before we discuss our two main objectives, however, and present illustrations and our specific hypotheses, an overview of social movements and their social psychology will help put our ideas in the broader context to which they are directed.
Or perhaps states were beginning to appreciate how ironic welfare reform really is. With the Supreme Court invalidating lower benefits for newcomers, states may now have even greater incentives to tighten up and make welfare less attractive.
Plainly winter was at hand., "Just as well we started when we did," said Bill. "No tellin' when she'll tighten up.", "May do it any time," Sam agreed.
Georg Simmel (1902) pointed out that the money economy pervasive in a city fosters individualism, blasé attitudes, and secondary relations, thus linking urbanism with a particular social psychology.
It is essential to identify user perspectives and relate their social psychology to meaningful trust determinants in the system to be automated.
The roots of black crime are threefold: a different social psychology resulting from blacks' exclusion from the dominant experience with factory, bureaucracy, and schooling; a heritage of economic and other insecurities; and a long and complex experience with criminal activity.

Despite the widespread performance and increasing popularity of the contemporary American bar mitzvah, exceedingly little serious secular study has been devoted to this uniquely tenacious ritual. Perhaps this lack of scholarly attention reflects the negative stereotypes of glitz and chopped liver center pieces, or the sense that this is, after all, a religious event "best left" to rabbis and Jewish educators.
The bad election results kept coming in, ticking past me one by one on the bottom of the television screen.

I'm leaning against a General Electric fridge of such purring, juddering, aerodynamic aspect that were I to unsuck the rubber-flanged door and climb inside, settle myself comfortably in amongst the bowls of chopped liver, the packets of frankfurters, the crinkly heads of lettuce, it might well lift off for the Forbidden Planet.
To "stitch aloft" is the best way on welts, too, for the same reasons stated above.
We had a run on chopped liver that morning, which was one of our biggest sellers. It was delicious, yes—more on that later—but people responded to the Yiddish saying that Uncle Murray had put in English next to the chopped liver platter listing on the menu, as he did with most of the entrées: Gehakteh leber iz besser vi gehakteh truris: Chopped liver is better than miserable troubles.
But, in stitching aloft, the groove in the sole should be deep enough to protect the thread from the buffing operation, provided that the lock cannot be reached; the nearer to the top, the better for the wear of the seam.

The current discussion of choice in education has been driven by this dueling banjos mentality in which scholars and other intellectual entrepreneurs compete for public and intellectual attention by describing the conditions they want to create.

This leads to the introduction of new kinds of abstract spaces—partially ordered linear spaces—and to their systematic use in functional analysis. The beginnings of a theory of partially ordered linear spaces are given in the works of L. V. Kantorovič in 1935-1937.
The chains in 𝒱 form a class 𝒞 which is partially ordered by inclusion.
Lest we exaggerate the difference between classes in real life, let us remember that our problem is essentially literary, not sociological: to explain the difference not between real peasants and real aristocrats, but between homo Aristophaneus and homo Platonicus.
Despite insistence that he was dealing with the literary man (‘homo Platonicus’ and ‘homo Aristophaneus’), and not the real Athenian aristocrat or farmer, [Kenneth] Dover tended to overlook the literary conventions: Pausanias in the ‘Symposium’ is not ‘homo Platonicus’ but simply one of the characters in the dialogue (who represents a fairly conventional aristocratic view, according to all the evidence); Aristophanes’ world is presented through the rather murky glass of comic distortion and requires interpretation.
In this paper we will show that partially ordered monads contain appropriate structure for modeling rough sets in a generalized relational setting.
In 1964 [Kenneth] Dover thought abuse found in comedy and elsewhere revealed in homo Aristophaneus a different, more simple set of attitudes, and his work after 1964 can be seen as an attempt to apply the hostility towards sexual passivity he saw in this abuse onto the discourses of Plato and Aeschines.

Place the plaque of conical molds, pointed side down, onto clean, empty, cardboard egg crates to support the molds so that they stand perfectly vertical.
Individual episodes are still thrilling and often quite striking, give or take some pitch-black battle scenes. But the gradual ramping up of the plotting that has grown steadily in the past three seasons crossed some invisible Maginot line this year, where the formerly acceptable trade-offs of focus for fun are no longer quite so taken for granted.
Fabric grids or egg crates, such as those made by Lighttools, work much the same way for different sizes of softboxes. These egg crates restrict the direction of the light and how much it spreads across the entire surface of the softbox or subject.
Egg crates are for use with softboxes. They fit into the front of the softbox over the diffuser panel. Their job is similar to that of the honeycomb grid, in that they are there to help restrict the spread of the light, giving you more directional control and less spill, whilst still maintaining a soft light.
Much like teachers are sometimes described as working in their separate little egg crates, school administrators can also be very isolated from one another.
Egg crates are a much less satisfactory model for schools.
Typically, egg crates are covered with waterproof pads and then sheets.

The brush is needed to whisk eraser dust away. The chief advantage of this eraser is that it may be sharpened to a point to erase a very small area.

A camp mother, who is introduced during registration, has been found a real asset in Massachusetts. She answers questions, solves small difficulties, and is especially in demand in mixed camps.
I would tell the camp mother, on my way out, so she would take charge while I was away.
I mean people that wanted to drum all day and people were trying to have conversations about stuff that had importance to what was going on politically, and so there was an ongoing sense for me of a kind of young and restless energy, and that without people like Jean McLaren, who was camp mother basically for the whole summer, it wouldn't have been anything like as successful as it was.
She recalls, for instance, songs about the loss of the mother which were sung in the camp at Stutthof (pp. 7-8) and in Auschwitz (p. 1 8). She often refers to the phenomenon of the "camp mother" or "camp daughter," where one woman would take another under her protection.

So what use is being given the freedom of the city?... The 1973 Local Government Act in Scotland allows for persons of distinction to be made "honorary freemen" in a council area. It helpfully adds that the title does not confer any rights or privileges and specifically rules out "grazing rights". The equivalent act of Parliament in England and Wales also stresses that this is a purely "honorary" title, although it does not feel it necessary to rule out grazing sheep.

Cookie Butter Treats Cookie butter is a lot like peanut butter, but it's made from blended cookies instead of nuts. There are a few different brands of cookie butter, so you should be able to find some at your local grocery store [ … ]
Cookie butter is all the rage right now and with good reason! It can be found in most supermarkets near the peanut butter. Its creamy sweetness works so well with the tart raspberries—but I won't lie... I usually just eat my cookie butter with a spoon.

For sure the milder planets did combine On thy auspicious horoscope to shine . . . And then, if ever, mortal ears Had heard the music of the spheres
Like that same mystic music of the spheres, Which no one hears, so loudly though it rings
We once believed in the music of the spheres but now we hear silence—static and silence.
A further wave of fluorescent balloons gently deflated, exhaling into miniature harmonicas to breathe an eerie music of the spheres.
a rich gown of velvet, and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch
The last works of Beethoven—the Symphony No. 9, the "Missa Solemnis," the late string quartets, the final piano pieces and the variations—are music of the spheres, mercurial, mysterious and never to be entirely understood.
The volunteers having finished their dinner, his majesty's health was given, in a bumper, by upwards of six thousand, all standing, uncovered, with three times three, and loud and reiterated acclamations of joy, accompanied by the music of all the bands.

Now the CEO of Isiah International Inc. has his sights set on nothing short of establishing an official farm league for the NBA, establishing a system similar to the one which currently operates in Major League Baseball.
Scenarios were floated that the CFL and WLAF would merge or that the CFL would revert to a fall schedule and become a farm league for the NFL.
Hire from the farm league. I constantly counsel church leaders to hire from within.

A partially ordered set means a pair (P,≻) consisting of a set P and a partial order ≻ in P. As usual, when the meaning is clear, we may suppress the notation of "≻" and speak of the partially ordered set P. The ordered fields defined earlier are easily seen to be examples of partially ordered sets.
The existing central pier could remain in service for construction of a new over bridge on-line.
Grade separator at a railway crossing can be either a road over bridge (ROB) with the road flying over the rail line or a road under bridge (RUB) with the rail line passing over the road.
In sections 7-10 we shall consider random fields over some subsets T of the partially ordered set T_M.
The invention of a derivative of a finite partially ordered set by Nazarova and Roiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s was a seminal event in the subject of representations of finite partially ordered sets (see [Simson 92]).

Wittgenstein was closer to the pay dirt in one of his letters to the philosopher G. E. Moore, when he talked about thought with due attention to what fascinated Heisenberg on his deathbed: turbulence.
Jesus falls again, and now some woman brings him a drink. I'm getting so tired of this whole sequence. When are they going to get to the fireworks factory!?
No, that's a different crazy Egyptian tycoon, and that's assuming he even is crazy, which is a pretty safe assumption because once Diana Spencer marries into your family all her new relatives are automatically crazy, especially if any of them produced the terrible Spielberg movie "Hook" in which Robin Williams takes forever to get to the fireworks factory.
The narrative going around about the new Godzilla, which waits about an hour before it finally gets to the fireworks factory, is that it’s a radical return to this kind of old-fashioned creature-feature restraint.
BHP Billiton chief executive Andrew Mackenzie has declared the Olympic Dam expansion is “game on” but admits there are technical and manufacturing hurdles that must be worked out before final approval is given to the giant project.
The ball glanced off the edge of his racquet.
Reader, gentle or simple, or whatever you be, how impatiently by this time must you expect this Preface, supposing it to be nothing but revengeful Invectives against the Author of the second Don Quixote.
When a maiden, gentle or simple, intendeth marriage against her kinsmen's wishes, it is the way to wed first, and to write the letter and ask the blessing when the evil is done."
When I told him the truth, he glanced away, and then replied...
And who is there amongst the gentle or simple that ever heard my name, that would bring me a cup of butter-milk, though they knew that I was parched with thirst ; or a morsel of bread if I were dying of hunger?
A Robinson Crusoe economy
Also, the man glaringly destitute of integrity or capacity, but noticed as having a bullet-head, a square jaw, countersunk eyes, and the rest in proportion, is suspected of having the other kind of force in reserve; and we know how he escapes anything like wanton personal indignity in his intercourse with gentle or simple.
Sir, cried the man, equally provoked, this is talking quite out of character ; for as to broken bones, there's ne'er a person in all England, gentle nor simple, can say he's a right to break mine, for I'm not a person of that sort, but a man of as good property as another man; and there's ne'er a customer I have in the world, that's more his own man than myself.
The implements of his daily work, which was that of a jobbing gardener, stood in a corner, and seeing probably that she looked rural, he said, 'If you want me to undertake country work I can't come, for I never leave Casterbridge for gentle nor simple -- not I."

Gular pumping also is increased significantly in response to airborne beef odor as compared to control (distilled water) odor (Weldon et al., 1990).
The broker, having arranged the deal, sends to Mr A. N. Other, or to the bank acting for him, a contract note (Figure 21.5).
Also unlike turtles, crocodylians close their nostrils and do not exhibit gular pumping when submerged, so underwater olfaction is unlikely (Bellairs and Shute, 1953; Weldon and Ferguson, 1993; Bellairs, 1971, in Weldon and Ferguson, 1993).

The American Consul at Leipzig requested the Chamber of Commerce of that city to furnish him with certain information concerning the preparation of rabbit’s skin for the hat trade. The Chamber replied that, although it was desirous of promoting the trade of Germany with foreign countries, it must, as a matter of principle, decline to furnish technical reports on German manufactures that would be likely to assist foreign competitors. The Leipziger Faerber Zeitung published the following, headed “Unfair Competition & Industrial Espionage" by the Consuls of the United States.”
Allegations of push polling have become increasingly common during recent election campaigns for all levels of public office in the United States, including the presidency, Congress, state legislatures, and state initiative campaigns.
Push polling is so antithetical to legitimate polling that in 1996 the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC), and the National Council on Public Polls (NCPP) issued a joint statement condemning the practice.
Their business model of the 1920s and 1930s, which had catapulted the business to undreamt-of heights, had then turned into something of a ball and chain.
Push polling has extended beyond the boundaries of the United States, although one Toronto Sun article referred to push polling as "a controversial U.S. style campaign tactic."
Do you think it's possible for two trains to have a cornfield meet right in the middle of an automatically protected block? Of course it is, if one of the hoggers is drunk or asleep at the throttle [ … ]
The 16th-century fluyts underwent yet another change: the cove, which we can see on Brueghel's engraving, and which had a helm port in it, through which the tiller entered the ship, disappeared.
Towards the end of the century the size of the helm port on large ships was much reduced by bringing the head of the rudder inside the ship.
One such instance when a conductor failed to follow a prescribed timetable resulted in a head-on smashup on the Long Island Railroad at the end of the Civil War. On August 28, 1865, General Grant and General Sherman collided in a pasture at Jamaica, New York. Five passengers were killed in this cornfield meet.
The author of the Magna Moralia has a passage which corresponds to Nicomachean Ethics IX 8 quite closely, but refuses to call the virtuous person 'self-loving' (philautos), reserving the word for common or garden selfish regard, and insisting that the virtuous person should be called 'good-loving' (philagathos) instead.
[A] couple of passenger trains staged a cornfield meet in the deep cut on Mount Holly, which the road settled with "gratuities" amounting to $50,000. By this time the Rutland had built up enough fiancial stability to weather these incidents with a minimum of distress.
Where common or garden matters are adequately coped with in the DN8, as for instance in connection with the Pastons, or with such personages as Dr Bentley and Archbishop Thomson, they have been largely left to that work.

They couldn't believe Indian soldiers who'd eaten the King's salt and been proud to serve in the army generation after generation could be suborned like that, buy their way out of prison camp by turning coat, come armed hand in hand with the Japs to fight their own countrymen, fight the very officers who had trained them, cared for them and earned their respect.

Because of this and various other reasons, the early soldiers and generals at Fort Pitt considered him a “turn coat” and renegade traitor of the Americans.
We spoiled an attack on members of our team and reduced the number of turn coats by fourteen.
Nancy is a quilting instructor and designer, specializing in miniature quilts and Hawaiian appliqué.
The stitch used in Hawaiian appliqué was simply a hemming stitch, Midori explained.
A roundrobin challenge allowed me to use this Hawaiian appliqué as a centerpiece.
The Hawaiian applique style was established during the second missionary generation (c. 1840-1860) (Hammond 1986b:278; Schleck 1987, pers. comm.).
Each quilter was assigned a quilt technique, such as Log Cabin style, Hawaiian applique, paper piecing, and so on.

In high context cultures, however, besides the spoken word, body language, gestures, shaking of the head and hand, each convey some meaning.
In high context cultures, most of the information is either in the physical context, or internalized in the person.
Jim stumped up for the cinema tickets, but I paid for the coffees afterwards.
In low context cultures, messages are mostly explicit and the words convey most of the meaning in the communication. In low context cultures, the impact of non-verbal cues is far less significant and the status of the speaker is less important in attaching meaning to what is said.
Not least because last spring, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that HM Treasury's new northern base would be in Darlington. If that doesn't encourage the Treasury to stump up cash to upgrade the town's station, then I fear nothing will.

Pending the completion of the Sinkiang railroad, the region is served by a number of major land routes that have been transportation links since ancient times. They are the North Road (north of the Tien Shan) passing from Kansu through Urumchi and Wusu, where it bifurcates into two routes going to the Soviet Union.
The first large-scale clash in Sinkiang occurred on January 26 at Shih-ho-tzu, a military outpost of eighty thousand inhabitants lying in the shadow of the massive Tien Shan range that separates China from the Soviet Union.

Thirteen people were injured in August 1957 when this Bristol freighter skidded on the runway at Southend Airport when landing with a flight from Calais. It ploughed through the boundary fence, but thankfully stopped short of the railway and the 1,500V overhead wires. A tripwire was installed on this section of Shenfield-Southend line to warn train drivers of instances such as this.

Too, it will discuss how American business has long been subject to blackmail by the racial grievance industry in the name of social justice; as well as the many other ways in which the regime of racial preferences has sowed division, corruption, and resentment in this country.
But he was slow – painfully slow, hour after hour slow, sweating and struggling in front of his own class slow – to accept the truth about the simple statement: the truth being that it is an ignis fatuus.
So, in any overall account of the social sciences, disputes are liable to break out about what is, or is not, truly scientific research; and, too often, these disputes generate more heat than light.

Some birds are lost. They are shot, taken by hawks, blown down in storms or trapped by other pigeon keepers. Regardless, the real homer man doesn't want them back.
In the Antwerp district was found a large type of pigeon, based on the blood of the old English carrier pigeon taken to Belgium by English fishermen and on the Dragoon, big and heavy wattled, a pigeon that reached maturity very early and at the age of a year was said to fly successfully the longest distances.

Hence, under tail risk, excess risk-shifting incentives of bank shareholders may exist almost independently of the level of initial or required capital.

His poetry helps me understand passion and mortality; his musings on negative capability help me understand how I can love and hate home at the same time. Negative capability, said Keats in an 1817 letter, “is when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason" (1818).
It also, however, contains the potential for negative capability that might help transform genocide into something generative.

While the definition of humanities is, of necessity, fairly vague, the definition of allied arts is clearer. The allied arts, as has been stated earlier, are a category within the broad scope of humanistic studies. The allied arts course is concerned with the study of such specific areas as music, literature, the fine arts, mass communication and dance.
A Revolutionary Tribunal was established [at Nantes ], of which Carrier was the presiding demon—Carrier, known in all nations as the inventor of that last of barbarous atrocities, the Republican Marriage, in which two persons of different sexes, generally an old man and an old woman, or a young man and a young woman, bereft of every kind of clothing, were bound together before the multitude, exposed in a boat in that situation for half an hour or more, and then thrown into the river.
Despite the fact that he feels himself to be essentially a Syrian and that he is acclaimed as the authoritative spokesman for the Arabic people in the allied arts, Gibran belongs to the world outside nationalistic interests and his art is a product of a deep sympathy with the problems which constitute the moving current of life in all nations and throughout all ages.
[The Committee on Allied Arts] hopes that the Committee on Publicity and the Journal of the Institute may be instructed to spread abroad, as a fundamental Institute principle, the belief that sympathetic, intelligent collaboration among the allied arts is, and always has been, the only sure road to a worthy architecture in any age or any land.

I remember, too, a ditty: "Fatty, fatty bom bom, curi curi jagung; mata-mata tangkap, masuk dalam lokap" (the fat one steals the corn, gets arrested by police and is thrown into the lock-up.
The financial crisis could have been avoided and was the result of poor decision making both in Washington and at top financial firms that fostered a culture of excessive risk taking, according to a draft report written by Democrats on a panel that investigated the meltdown and obtained by Reuters
Soon, there were all sorts of derivatives - fatty, fatso, fatty bom bom, Trim and Fit club (arguably not the children's fault) - so much so that by the time someone reaches adulthood, the term had become a source of deep emotional pain.
“Fatty bom bom” refers to an Ah Pui; “bom bom”, as the sound a heavy, wobbling body makes, dramatizes fatness.
But there's these poor, miserable trash have children like sixty; and there's folks living in splendid houses, dying for children, and can't have any.
In transcribing them, I have inserted one or two apostrophes, for the poet always complained that though he could spell like sixty, he never could mind his stops.
'By the great Caesar's ghost, I believe you! You're the stupidest dunderhead I ever saw or ever heard of, so help me Moses! The idea of you being a pilot--you! Why, you don't know enough to pilot a cow down a lane.'
Summon Auntie is a Singlish phrase that describes meter attendants, usually middle-aged women, who give parking fines to cars that are illegally parked
That Maine water was so cold that he came to like sixty sore as a pup and wanting to fight Joe.
The New Paper recently wrote a story on Feb. 4 about the plight of parking enforcement officers, also known as parking wardens or summon aunties
I charged at those trees going like sixty — at least sixty, whatever it means — and was well in among them when a strange thing happened.
All of us in the islands of the North Atlantic should recognise new alignments are necessary and "we should be prepared to sacrifice for the new shared future".
For some strange reasons, some people are shouting "Huat ah"as they toss paper money in the air.
Some kids still can't read yet. But they are dumb, dumb-bells, dumb bunnies. Morag can read like sixty. Sometimes she doesn't let on in school, though.
The lo hei dish eaten by Singaporeans to herald the Chinese New Year with shouts of "Huat ah!” festive greetings exemplifies a Chinese cuisine with local Singaporean identity.
Maybe the truth was that all of them — himself, the kids, Uncle Henry, Mrs. Biggs, even Argyle — were bailing like sixty, trying to stay afloat in their sorry little tubs.
And, I wish everyone a Happy New Year for the upcoming new year. Let's Huat ah!!
12 New Stunning Looks Based On Your Zodiac to HUAT AH This Chinese New Year
A saleman did not tear off the date tabs of four parking coupons worth $ 4.40, making the coupons re-useable, a district court heard yesterday.
A parking coupon displayed on the windscreen of the car showed that he parked the car on 29 April at 6.15 p.m.
What makes this worse is taxis parking at the car park without displaying parking coupons, some with the engines running, while the drivers are resting or meeting at the nearby taxi hut.
[ … ] I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea; Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
It has a section that looks like a parking coupon on each page and you can tear out the tabs.
To do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants who are not content with a mere fiend-dog, but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes.
The cards had pre-cut curves above each number, so all you had to do was to push them in and fold - just one step shy of tearing the date and time tabs on a parking coupon.
I had a friend who would SMS me the most bo liao messages. I’m glad it’s stopped now.
It seemed to him this must needs be a marvel.
Having to manage that part is rather ‘bo liao’ and I felt my limited energy can be better served somewhere.

When either the red plate (indicating very hot weather above 32 deg C) or the orange plate (indicating hot weather between 30 and 32 deg C) are displayed, a water parade must be conducted before, and during, training. In a water parade, soldiers line up and drink water.
Laughter from everyone. Even Mr. Poteet, tired of trying to drill history into the heads of the twins, lets out with a real belly buster.
When working in hot environments, each worker should be encouraged to quench their thirst all the time and consume at least to 500 ml of water every hour. Supervised drinking or “water parades” can help ensure this.
Do you know that every recruit undergoing Basic Military Training (BMT) has to drink eight to 10 litres of water during water parades to prevent dehydration?
Construction workers are also given personal water bottles and "water parades" - similar to those in military training where soldiers are told to drink lots of water - are also conducted.

“You mean our little beach girl? Oh, she's just a passing whim of Ross's. You know how he is. Always has to be different. She's most likely the result of a midlife crisis.”
Macquarie University academic Anthony Lambert explained the essence of Australia's troubled fascination with the case and with the island of Bali and Indonesia overall: "Schapelle occupies the place of the mythical Australian beach girl ,,, now trapped in a 'strange' land, in non-white hands, and at the mercy of foreign systems and institutions".
I remember a punk friend - cockerel haircut, leather trousers, bovver boots, and ripped jumper - being shocked at the TV retrospective of the mid-eighties where long-haired oiks in flared trousers stared desultorily at some screaming youths on stage.
Do their speakers semantically align supposedly raw data with supposedly raw text (that is, ASCII) and supposedly raw footage (unedited film or video) the way that English speakers do?
This boy damn act cute, I buay tank.
The various youth subcultures have been identified by their possessions and objects: the boot-lace tie and velvet-colourd drape jacket of the Ted, the close crop, parker coats and scooter of the Mod, the stained jeans, swastikas and ornamented motorcycles of the bike-boys, the bovver boots and skinned-head of the Skinhead, the Chicago suits or glitter costumes of the Bowieites, etc.
Lonely mudpie for lonely people. Going to watch Ah Boys to Men at 6:05pm. Really buay tank the loneliness here.
Their image of racism was not what our political culture has come to expect – that is, the Nazi, the shaven-headed skinhead with bovver boots. Rather, they were stylishly dressed in suits and wearing Ben Sherman shirts and Armani sunglasses.

We met in Council at the Long House.
In the South every negro preacher is ex officio a D.D., and is commonly addressed as Doctor. This enables white Southerners to show a decent respect for his sacred office, and yet avoid the solecism of calling him Mister.
The practice of herding together in ‘long houses’ prevents mental and moral improvement and hinders advance in gardening and planting and agricultural developement generally.
Meanwhile, to Samsonov’s annoyance, Colonel Knox had arrived in Ostrolenka. Why, nobody knew—probably just to convey the goodwill of the British, who would not themselves be landing on the Continent for another six months. Samsonov disliked those artificial, ex officio European smiles at the best of times, and this visitor would be a hindrance and a distraction just at present.

Most “conscious uncouplings” after 50 are initiated by financially stable women who are still working or have enough money to set out solo.
Few organisations have an enterprise relationship management strategy, few have documented processes and can verbalise how relationships are created and maintained. Even fewer can describe how relationships are exited in a way that all parties remain whole through 'conscious uncoupling'.

There's no use trying to tell him; he won't listen.
H. T. Webster's comic strip, "The Timid Soul," in the Oakland Tribune of September 10, 1950 used the tendency to repeat worn phrases as the subject for the hero's good intentions. The following are recorded: . . . Don't take any wooden nickels.
There's no use crying over spilt milk.
It's no use trying to push the car out of the ditch; the axle is broken.

New Yorkers, who don't really go anywhere ever, are the worst offenders. They think anything north of New York is Bridgeport. Bridgeport, Connecticut is the Watford Gap of America.
This collection may not bridge the Watford Gap, but any joshing at the expense of our southern cousins is good-natured and laughter-lovers from both sides of the divide are welcomed.
Hey, watch it with the extended vocabulary — there are children here.

It is common, not only for perception verbs but also for verbs that convey a metaphorically directional action with partially affected objects (especially animate objects), to display canonical indirect transitive constructions.
Overall children's performance on direct transitive event (e.g. girl crumpling a paper) was not significantly different from their performance on the indirect transitive event (e.g. man putting powder in a liquid that changes its color).

Even Neil Risch, the contemporary genticist whose work has done the most to gain acceptance for a race realist viewpoint, both within the academy and among the wider public, is 'not sure what race means [because] people use it in many different ways.'
It was the section of the North Midland Railway from Derby to Ambergate which provided the springboard for a scheme that took shape in the early part of 1845 for a route through the Peak to Manchester.
Some authors also refer to this kind of approach as critical realism (cf. Parks, 2007, who develops what he calls a critical race realist approach, as discussed in Section 6.3.1).

By rights, the making of To Wong Foo should have been fun for Patrick, Wesley, and John, but from the first it was pistols at dawn.
Some authorities supply different coloured bins for kerbside paper and other types of rubbish collection, but in most cases you will have to bring bottles, cans, paper and other recyclable waste to a bring centre or civic amenity centre.
They declare ringing confirmation for their theories even in the face of feeble data.
Bring centres have set opening and closing times similar to Recycling Centres but are smaller in size and serve a smaller community.

They are a redundancy, in a sense, because in Miami Beach a man can get clipped in enough dim whiskey caverns without adding a lush worker to his expense account.
That software has dirty code and we should not use it.
Lush workers operate in trains, buses, street cars, waiting rooms, and parks. They select a prospective victim who is apparently sleeping or unconscious. Sometimes they test their victim by gently kicking or tapping them as they pass by. If the victim does not react, the lush worker proceeds to take the victim's money and other valuables.
[T]he lowest servants at Hampton Court used the great communal toilet capable of seating fourteen people at once named the ‘Common Jakes’ or the ‘Great House of Easement’.

Groote riot: Police fear those responsible for deaths may have gone bush and be difficult to locate
Kitty was now living at Pan Quee's station in Humpty Doo with her Aboriginal husband Lukana and her father Yuliera. During the war they had all gone bush so as to avoid compulsory evacuation.
[ … ] I had a pretty good notion of the weather conditions generally, on account of I was out in them.
For a brown stew, the meat and sometimes the vegetables are browned in hot fat before being simmered
Truth is I was the kind of fellow who people would run away from when they seen me coming on account of I was so full of facts and names and places and families I had to tell about.
The menu in respect of each day of the week ended 11th September, 1959, for a Dublin Barracks was as follows:— ... [Date] 9-9-59 ... [Dinner] Brown Stew [etc.]
There’s everything from Eva Holmes’ piquant salad dressing or Edward Hayden’s lemon and thyme stuffing, to Mrs Cusack’s brown stew or Antonia Bottoni’s Cape Malay chicken curry.
After that, I resumed walking, on account of it involves little contact with strangers.
Increasingly preferred was the method known as "brown stew". Sullivan had recommended adding a brown gravy to broiled kingfish and stewing junefish in a brown sauce, thickened with flour.
In other words, at the point where the infinite past and the infinite future collide into the present of a nunc stans they spark into existence, as it were, the mental phenomenon of a timeless present which overcomes all ordinary time constructions.
In its radical transcendence of all finite states the subject enters into the space of a nunc stans, in the face of which all temporality becomes an unreal appearance.
Don't use the steel wool on this pan; you'll strip off the Teflon coating.
I've worn the pity hat, eaten the pity pie, and sung the blues. But I've learned over time that it isn't worth carrying that baggage through life.
Maybe another divorced kid is the best kind of friend a divorced kid can have.
“Come on,” Wallace said, loping past me toward the van. “I'll buy you some pie.” Pity pie. That was what he was thinking. He thought I liked him, and he needed to buy me pity pie. Could this day get any worse? I sighed and followed after them.
“I mean about me,” said John, “but, as usual, let's talk about you.”, “At least I rank among the innocents,” Howard noted. “And my team thinks it deserves a tad more of the pity pie.”
The icon of the blue ribbon on her site should not be taken to mean she opposes parental filtration programs.
The California Highway Commission may, after a public hearing, determine that angle parking may be permitted on certain portions of through State highways, where in its opinion same may be done with safety and without unduly restricting the flow of State highway traffic, under the special circumstances shown to exist.
The governor selected a cadre of blue ribbon social scientists to serve on her poverty task force.
Public support for angle parking was expected to be quite high because of the greater ease in parking. Since parallel parking is more difficult and cumbersome, the public would prefer angle parking because it is relatively effortless. Merchants were also expected to support (in fact, to advocate) angle parking because it offered a business advantage to them. With angle parking, business streets can accommodate a larger number of cars, thereby improving customer access to shops.
As parallel parking accommodated fewer cars, it substantially opened up streets to view, making them, in relative terms, look vacuous and making the downtown appear a place more for passing through. On the other hand, angle parking made downtown streets look crowded and made the downtown appear more a place for terminating trips.

Man and woman, I said? In this day and age, forget gender! The problem is even more poignant if we consider any combination of Homo and Hetero sapiens getting married. Which name do they take?
He hopes his life story – of the illiterate ex-hockey coach turned Conservative senator – can inspire others. Jacques Demers . . . is slated for a seat in the red chamber, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced today.
I wish merely to caution you against the whole tone of L'Etoile's suggestion, by calling your attention to its ex parte character at the outset.
Seven new senators will soon take their seats in the Red Chamber, appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Grand juries are conducted ex parte; neither the suspect nor his attorney may attend.

I can't get about so much since I hurt my hip.
Old Pottsie, the boss, used to belt Yammatji with a hobble chain. He got my uncle and got the hobble chain and belted him with it. But my uncle never fell down, even when he got hit hard.

If this story gets about then I'm finished.
As defined by English judges, common law itself offered tenants some minimal protections that eighteenth-century New York rentiers had often ignored. Thus the legal custom of landed society had exempted from seizure beasts of plow, certain essential household goods, and especially the implements of trade unless all other remedies had proved insufficient.
That's the third party Brenda's been to this week. She certainly gets about.
Over the years, historians of the late-medieval English gentry have mapped out several working models to explain the character and behavior of landed society in various localities around the country.
It was a landed society, a society which regarded only land and landed wealth as ultimately acceptable in creating status.
I've got some things to do for about an hour. After that, get at me.
In addition, it is perhaps of equal importance that in a landed society those at the top of the pyramid have interests in common and little to divide them.
He was too busy playing the big, important businessman to care about anyone but himself, preferring the company of his bum chum, Pete, to me.
Societies that own tombs or halls are sometimes known as landed' societies. The three oldest landed societies are Skull and Bones (1832), Scroll and Key, (1841) and Wolf's Head, (1883).
In October 1940 the Forestry Commissioners enlisted the services of forestry and landed societies to help with the distribution of wire and rabbit netting to private estates requiring it for afforestation purposes.
One other important figure in postmodern thought is Richard Rorty, who might be characterized as master of the scare quote
He is inordinately fond of the scare quote, a sign that he is not really sure of what he's talking about.
An incidental pleasure is his witty mastery of the scare quote and the square bracket.
And though his money was now gone again, all but a sovereign or two, yet that troubled him but little, in the first flush of being at sea.
I put the relevant pronouns in scare quote because Bundy’s interviewers succeeded in getting Bundy to talk about his crimes only by allowing him to describe them in the third person
He had not been there more than a few minutes when the attack was made, and in the first flush of the onslaught he received a gun-shot in the thigh which completely shattered the bone and left him helpless upon the ground.
You're not old, Major, but you're not in the first flush.
Gentle Annie Hill, New Zealand
Forty-three long grassers were interviewed in their first language. The reasons they gave for living in the long grass were complex, ranging from the inability to afford a flight back to their home community after accessing medical treatment, to a desire to escape disputes and conflicts in their community, to an enjoyment of the 'freedom of living in the long grass'.

Sherman started from Atlanta in the middle of November. He cut a wide swath of desolation through the South.
The purpose is twofold: to show the reader the lions in the Arabian linguistic terrain, those unions of pattern and meaning in which the language may take special pride; and, where appropriate, to see what formal procedures are used in our own back yard to handle the same semantic task.
Swinging his bloody horns from side to side the beast cut a wide swath before him.
Instead of there being a single unified groundwork of all experience and knowledge, Wittgenstein is alleged to show us that the linguistic terrain is broken up into subdivisions each with its constitutive forms of representation .... Thus, Wittgenstein's appeal to the diversity of language is construed as the claim that there are numerous subdivisions to the linguistic terrain and not a single whole to be delimited.
I knew about heart checks from Rossetti – one of the few members of my security team who'd been to prison.
The twister cut a wide swath of destruction in Utica, a town of 2,000 people about 90 miles southwest of Chicago.
Ufuk Bozoglu, owner of Oz Turks Jnr in Sydney’s Redfern and star of Kebab Kings, made the halal snack pack (or HSP) that inspired Luke Eagles and his mates to create the group.
When H. Meyersahm, in a dissertation of 1891, studied literal theonymy, the giving to humans of unadjusted divine names, he felt able to declare that the practice first emerged in the first century AD .
There are a few instances of mortals called Artemis or Hermes, but such literal theonymy is relatively rare, and mostly dates from the first century ad or later.
So you just want to be friends, huh? Yeah, I think I know what that means. I become some kind of emotional tampon you need three or four days out of the month... when no one else will take your fucking bullshit
The orbiters in her life in high likelihood like to talk about this and make themselves her emotional tampon and outlet.
The million-dollar question is what mechanisms and representations (potentially unlearned, potentially domain-specific) exist so that the learner, given the input, gradually comes to behave like an adult language user.
Under the name of " compound oxygen " or " liquid oxygen," it has been used in its liquid form by quacks, and has been sold as a patent medicine ; and has cured some who had experienced no relief from treatment ordinarily adopted for such cases.
From a web page archived by Britain's National Archiveshttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/fleet-air-arm/helicopter-display-team-black-cats/index.htm: The team name derives from the Lynx wildcat of 702 Naval Air Squadron’s badge and also the naval slang of “Black Catting” which implies having done or owned something better than anyone else.
This was not just another quack cure. This was on sale exclusively from the duty-free trolley on Continental Airlines. What was it? Liquid oxygen, that's what.
For more mind-numbing claptrap, how about “all-natural liquid oxygen” drops under the tongue to fight jet lag, fatigue, hangover, and aging skin?
I think that cheese would be better off in the fridge.
The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. So, wake up, Mr. Freeman. Wake up and smell the ashes.
The only hope of meeting this objection is to show not only that valid argumenta ad hominem are possible as well as invalid ones, but also that a valid argumentum ad hominem can properly be used to attack a philosophical view as well as to discredit the testimony of those who advocate the view.
Apple Inc. is valued at $500 billion but since they have $200 billion in cash and no debt, their enterprise value is only $300 billion
In this instance the departure is radical: this is a real car crash of a ballad, impacted (the beginning and end have crushed together) and distorted, yet still recognizable.
The evidence is lacking to decide between alternative explanations and in any case these are argumenta ad hominem which should not be used in scientific discussion; the facts are the only things that matter, and on those grounds there is no doubt that the hereditarians were largely in the wrong in what they asserted.
He's probably forgotten about that part of our exchange already. I mean, the rest of it wasn't a total car crash ... was it?
^({1})The respective statements are packaged differently, as direct accusations or insinuations, as topoi of threats (argumenta ad baculum or argumenta ad hominem) and occur in many contexts, especially in semi-public ones, i.e. in interviews or in TV discussions just as in the memorial vigil (see below). ^({2})Greed, dishonesty and vindictiveness constitute the content prejudices appearing in this context, not least in the linguistic form of fallacious argumenta ad hominem.

The conflict between desire and programming may explain the common myth (or as we Micks like to think, well-known fact) that Catholics go off like frogs in a sock in the sack.
In reality, such argumenta ad hominem are designed to show that, therefore, the nature of the thing in question is so evident that its evident traits are also recognized by the opponent, at least when some clear instances of the disputed datum are brought up; and that therefore the recognition of the true nature of the thing in question by the opponent himself leads to an inconsistency with the false elements in his position.
I guarantee that if you make something really cool, her knickers'll be off quicker than a frog in a sock.
Skinner told the court he was an experienced ticket tout who travelled the world buying and selling tickets and merchandise to sporting events, concerts and festivals.
Around 11pm BB King appears onstage, much of his audience one over the eight, talkative but mellow, ready for what is (in my book at least) the experience of a lifetime.
To put it mildly, Brendan, you don't appear at your best on television when you've got one over the eight.
As it is, I would defend her honor even though I died in that defence.
But from Aurukun, where all the children were sent bush with their parents as a war precaution, MacKenzie feared that ready availability of cash would spell the end for traditional skills.
Gibber plains are often covered with a very open low shrubland (see below).
Now, nobody knows what IT is exactly, but as dot-com companies, purveyors of the Last Big Thing, bite the dust, we're ready to grasp at anything — even if we don't know what it is.
You might call Web services the Last Big Thing. The surprise is that today, in the midst of an IT downturn that has become a way of life, Web services really is changing everything.
We were to learn also, as we approached Bedourie and Sandringham, that to the east the Simpson Desert is bounded by stony desert or Gibber plain, which interdigitates with the sandhill-claypan country.
Who is the only Lodestar vice president whose reputation hasn't been compromised by the failure of one of these Next Big Things?
Gibber plains vary in character according to local sources of bedrock, with limestone gibbers, for example, adjacent to the northern Flinders Ranges (Twidale, 1994) and silcrete gibbers mantling a deflated surface in the Sturt Stony Desert (Thomas, Clarke and Pain, 2005).
With raves from scientists, food writers, and journalists alike, the Mediterranean Diet swept into magazines, cookbooks, and kitchens around the world, instantly nutrition's Next Big Thing.
Despite being a raging liberal, he was always mindful of my pretention-fueled, Fox Newsian conservatism.
The traditional version of the story continues that Baabie Pitcairn ran to the body, stooped over it and took a paper from the inside pocket – her marriage lines.
There is no need to hurry. If Bahadur was bombed as the television program said, then it is not going anywhere. If the Katyushas were also bombed and the cave was breeched, that is also not going anywhere.
Again, college is not going anywhere, and a change in direction can always happen at a later date. Regardless of the ultimate decision to go or not to go, make an action plan with discrete goals, and a timeline for achieving these goals.
Music has a huge influence on just about everything around us. No matter how people try to disrespect it or reject it, it's not going anywhere. It's here to stay.
The second one was a gag gift for Private First Class Dubee. He had this man crush on a male professional wrestler. We managed to get a digital shot of Dubee standing next to a poster of his man crush.
No, he said plainly. I'll leave this café. But I won't leave you. That's what I mean. I'm not going anywhere.
And I think my question, and I have just one, would be for your, Mr. Toomey, on this question of, well, the science is not going anywhere and it is not going to produce any big gains—let me just read you a sentence from just one of the letters from a physician and scientific groups that I am putting in the record today.
Far from feeling threatened, my girlfriend finds solace in them and would view any young man not admitting to a man crush as uncomfortable with his sexuality.
We're not going anywhere. We've never gone anywhere. We're not even going to the playoffs.
[…] Her old man crushes were always just that—crushes. But maybe she really is dating him. […]
His career is not going anywhere.
That is not how it is, however—the beings in samsara did not come from nirvana to samsara, so they did not come from anywhere, and therefore they are not going anywhere either.
We talk a bit about the man crushes we have in common, recount our conquests, celebrate our fabulous younger selves. We don't talk about the men we lost, or how utterly decimating the eighties were, or how lucky we are to be sitting here, drinking ourselves silly.
What is the point of going down a dead-end road when you know it's not going anywhere?
[…] for a certain faction of American women, the accent is swoon-worthy on its own. I will confess that the Darcy accent I concocted in my head while reading Pride and Prejudice for the first time was a huge contributor to my fictional man crush.
He replaced McNair because of cramp in the last few minutes, and was essentially meat in the room.
N is a vegetarian who doesn’t like aubergines, from which I think you can conclude he only became veggie because he’s not a huge fan of food. He’s only there for company, just meat in the room (ironically).
He pointed the bang stick at the closest shark and braced for the impact.
Benedict went into the office in the far corner of the barn and came out with a seven- or eight-foot-long stick with what looked like a hypodermic taped on the end with duct tape. It wasn't a bang stick - but it looked like one had inspired its creation.
Sparks suddenly had seen the light and Frick and Frack had their eyewitness identification.

Quoth I, "This I did by accident not of malice prepense;" and quoth he, "If thou didst it by accident, I will do the like by thee with intention."
Just a mention of the man's name conjures up visions of 18 wheelers, diesel smoke belching from stacks, smokey bears, CB radio and its almost unintelligible jargon and the endless ribbon of interstate highways that seemingly go on forever.
Well, we gotta get to Big Bear Mountain before those smokey bears close off the entrance to the mountains.
Mrs. Dallow complied, placing herself opposite to him in the boat; but as he took up the paddles she declared that she preferred to remain on the water—there was too much malice prepense in the temple. He asked her what she meant by that, and she said it was ridiculous to withdraw to an island a few feet square on purpose to meditate. She had nothing to meditate about which required so much attitude.
Aircraft used to spread Agent Orange and other defoliants were known as Smokey Bears.
"Where's Professor Snape?" shouted a girl from the Slytherin table. "He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk," replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws.
“Let her be the bear bait in that bright red Mustang Cobra,” Jim said with a grin.
"Ya haah, there goes our bear bait!" Ricky shouted as he stepped on the throttle to move past 75. "Bear bait?" "Yeah, she'll drive point for us, in case there's any smokies — any patrol — ahead."
There was also a game representing a bear bait.
Once you've tried a toastie from a toastie maker, you'll never want to eat regular sandwiches again.
Plague was another reason why the authorities were concerned about gatherings such as bear baits. Many bear baits seem to have taken place at alehouses, and attracted large numbers of people.
On the building site, vaporizing of mineral turpentines represents a major problem and is associated with nerve damage and other serious health problems.

When hydrostatic lock is suspected or exists, stop cranking immediately and notify unit maintenance.
Net net, we're losing money.
Cavitated liners can also leak combustion gases into the cooling system, but they tend to produce hydrostatic locks after the engine is shut down when hot.
After an empty boat has been once weighed, she is numbered, and her weight is registered at the several hydrostatic locks.
Net net, what do we have to do today?
The canal employed a series of hydrostatic locks—also called bear traps—that would create an “artificial flood” that changed water levels, allowing the barges to flow freely in either direction.
Wild tomatoes, which had gone to seed or been remorselessly hoed out from the beginning of Berande, were foraged for salads, soups, and sauces.
Hydrostatic locks are being successfully employed in tower cookers, and have been demonstrated to be sound in reduced size form from an engineering standpoint.
Vertical sterilizers use hydrostatic locks on inlet and outlet sides. Packages are placed in transverse carriers attached to twin roller-chains, which move through the sections of the hydrostatic sterilizer.
But the "frump" will let herself and all her surroundings go to seed, not from humbleness of mind or an overwhelming sense of her own unworthiness, but in pure complacent conceit.
Descend some twenty feet through the pleasant warmth of the ocean's upper layer and you are in water as cold as a witch's kiss.
But suppose I hang about till eighty and die a childish old gentleman with a mind all gone to seed.

The fact is, that fixed air is so rare a vapour and the Mephitic Acid, as I shall already venture to call it, is so greatly diluted in water, which is even saturated with it, that many of the blue juices relist its action upon them; while others, more sensible tests of acidity (such as infusions of Litmus, Cyanus, or Corn-flower, and a few others) readily announce its acid quality.
Here comes the choo-choo train! Open wide!
The carbonic acid has been called the mephitic acid; nitrogen has been called the mephitic air; but the true derivation of this term, from which it ought never to have been diverted, is mephuhith.
The early morning crowds [at a railway station] were known as "daily breaders", until the importation of the term "commuter" from the USA.

Our nickel tour doesn't do justice to GA mechanics, but even a longer explanation would leave us scratching our heads and asking how such simple operators might do anything useful, let alone promote an effective, robust search for good stuff.

Thus, if A, B, and C are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points P satisfying (1) is called a “generalised circle.” It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.
No-one ventured to the Bluff or Toronui, but a van resembling a sardine tin went on a tiki tour of the huge Waipoura kauris.
What we need is people who get the job done, no matter how. We don't want pickers who'll only learn if we use their preferred learning method. Have you read "A Message to Garcia" ? That's what we need today - young people who can deliver the message to Garcia.
The aim was to fly down, run the half, do a quick tiki tour of the company's salmon fishery and then fly home.
Programmers are consistently dehumanized because so many do indeed deliver the message to Garcia only to be at best ignored.
Liz's vowels have sat in a few places and can still sound like a bit of a Tiki tour in a single sentence.
“After something to eat and drink we'll all go for a Tiki tour around the farm,” said Steve.

Always strain the cream into the churn through a fine piece of butter muslin, and never fill it more than one-third full; otherwise there will not be sufficient agitation when the cream is churned.
The same was also effected by the bott hammer, a flat mallet, with its face cut into grooves, the handle to it being curved, and this being repeatedly struck on a quantity of fibre spread out on a board, first on one side and then on the other.
My friends dismissed him as a Kerry sheep thief and a bog Irish gombeen man.
“Ye stupid, stupid, bloody woman,” he said. “I'd forgive ye if it was the first time and put it down to pure, unadulterated, bog Irish buck ignorance, but it's not bloody well the first time, and ye knew exactly what ye were up to. Didn't ye? Didn't ye?"

Authors have in general supposed the Bulam Fever to be only a higher grade of the Bilious Remittent, as this last is of the Intermittent; and the following eight points have been enumerated by Dr. Pinckard as a proof of their identity; to which eight points I beg to make the following replies.

“I really did want someone who also has to be on blast and be judged in the public forum of writing lyrics and has to sing and has to play instruments,” Bridwell continues, “someone that understands the weight that carries around with it. And someone who knows the industry side of it. That was the main lightning rod. This guy is going to get it more than anyone else could. He has been on both sides of the damn desk. At least I’ll have a good ear to bend if shit goes wrong.”
Jim Murphy is on blast... for being dismissive of the England football team.
After Michael Flynn resigned/was fired as National Security Advisor, everyone breathed a sigh of relief when the top prospect to replace him turned out to be Retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward. . . . Harward pulled out, reportedly calling the offer a "shit sandwich."
The antitrust application will link Air Tahiti Nui to the existing antitrust immunised alliance between Air France, KLM, Delta and Alitalia to form the centrepiece of the proposed metal neutral alliance and revenue sharing on the Los Angeles-Paris route and for codesharing beyond Paris CDG.
Ending the evening with an Abba song really lifted up the crowd.
This is somewhat ironic, given that the DOT now prefers metal neutral joint ventures as a mechanism to lower fares.

Four pages of polemic, ridicule, rhetoric, innuendo, calumny, detraction, contumely, begging of questions, a prioris, argumentums ad hominem, pathetic fallacies, ignoratio elenchis, undistributed middles… (regaining thread) Not even Kendall’s finest lyric achievement is safe from Grigsby’s flailing haymakers and knees to the groin.

I would have no quarrel with the above. If someone DISAGREES it’s one thing. But people go further and tell me I’m WRONG, dead wrong, tasteless, lacking in judgment (we are now getting into the area of argumentums ad hominem (attacking the person instead of the argument).
These are also the same women who complain about the so-called "one minute man".
Red does not like “one minute men” and she says no to “short dick” men, in fact she even has a mantra to keep small-endowed men away: "If it's not seven inches or more, don't even look in my door".
Although this is obviously a love song, I'm going to assume that Allen husband is no one minute man. Can't you work things out, girl?
He'd gotten into tremendous shape so that he could run around his backhand and avoid hitting it altogether. He even tried a left-handed forehand. That was how desperate he was.
You know who I'm talking about: The one-minute men! We all had a lot of fun when Missy Elliott and Ludacris sang about them back in the day, but it's no laughing matter for a lot of folks.

The activity of the yeast extract does not last long; it had vanished after being kept five days in an ice cupboard, but lasted for two weeks when mixed with cane-sugar solution.
At one end were five service lifts, and at the other an ice cupboard where we stored milk and butter. When you went into the ice cupboard you dropped a hundred degrees of temperature at a single step; it used to remind me of the hymn about Greenland's icy mountains and India's coral strand.
All my eye and Betty Martin, thought I, I will have no more truck with you.
Proving that when good things come they come in pairs, Moss Kelly (9) was the twice proud father or twin boys last Thursday . . . this makes Louise Splane (3) a double aunt or something.
Oh, that's all my eye and Betty Martin! Nobody believes that, I should hope.
For example, the tribesmen of Central Australia, depending largely upon the witchity grub as a food supply, make bowers in imitation of the cocoon, and perform elaborate dances in imitation of the emergence of the grub, believing that thereby they cause the grubs to multiply.
Minutes later it was over and the victim, Doug, an advertising executive in Connecticut, had been raped by a woman. Occurrences of reverse rape have increased dramatically in recent years.
Bins the bowl as he says "Falsehoods and a man of straw is all my eye and Betty Martin saw"
Judith's decapitation of Holofernes is often interpreted as a kind of reverse rape, in which a woman penetrates the male body rather than allowing a man to penetrate her own.

"It's called Helsinki Syndrome.” Dr. Pantu said to the Doctor over the telephone. “The kidnapped, or hostages, begin to identify with their captors."
In the same field as brain washing but acting with almost immediate effect is a response now called the “Helsinki Syndrome" after an event that occurred in that city. Bank robbers took captive some bank staff after a robbery went wrong.
"I suppose you mean to say that he has given orders that I am not to be admitted?"... "Oh, Mr. Harry, you shouldn't ask me, as is merely a servant." ..."That's all my eye, Matthew; you know all about it as well as any one. It is so. He does not want to see me."
Niles wanted to know if Dr. Davis was familiar with the Helsinki Syndrome, where hostages were brainwashed into thinking of their captives as friends.
A precise description of mechanism of injury can guide the examination, eg flexion/extension injury over lap sash seatbelt is associated with small bowel injury and lumbar vertebral fractures.
And had she even once mentioned that in reality Beauty was a hostage suffering from Helsinki syndrome?
I've read about the Helsinki syndrome, when the victim becomes attached to his or her tormentor.

"Conspicuous consumption" is a proof of economic success.
Professional humanists . . . resent Veblen's saying that knowing an ancient language is conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste, like growing your fingernails long and painting them, or keeping a Pekingese.
As we have seen, points at infinity behave as ordinary points: a single line passes through two distinct points at infinity or through a point in the plane and a point at infinity. This representation of the points at infinity is a difference between the disc and the half-plane models of Poincaré, [ … ] .
To describe a parabolic transformation f of the hyperbolic plane, we consider two parallel lines l and l’ and we call ω their common point at infinity.
As a society becomes richer, those whose incomes do not grow spend more on conspicuous consumption in an attempt to keep up.

The champ had his opponent on the ropes at the end of the third round and knocked him out in the fourth.
Wear all that stink pretty and stuff, you know.
In ecology theory, the principle of competitive exclusion states that multiple species in competition for the same resource cannot coexist, as even the slightest advantage of one species over the other is successively amplified; a mechanism referred to as “rich get richer” or preferential attachment. This eventually leads to the extinction of the inferior species.
He was inducted into the Trial Lawyers Hall of Fame.
Nikolai Joukowski (1847-1921) was a Russian mathematician who did research in aerodynamics (James and James, 1992). He used circle inversion in the complex number plane to study airfoil shapes.
As is common with nonlinear projections, it is possible to come up with many variants of circle inversions.[ … ]An obvious (but perhaps not very useful) extension of circle inversion is sphere inversion, where the spaces inside and outside a sphere are swapped.

One particular species of these candidates seems to be not dark at all: so-called dark hydrogen masses located in the optical Galactic disk.
The over-unity energy production could be due to a gradual transformation of hydrogen to dark hydrogen in the same state as in water.
Moneypenny reminding Bond of his responsibilities and limitations curtails the textual harassment of the character.
His letter […] was written, currente calamo, with very little trouble.
Iraneus contrasts the unity and integrity of these writings with the distorted, contextless citations of the Gnostics. He describes the code of textual harassment that allows these heretics to chip away at the Scriptures, […].

Particular professors and sober Scotchmen may denounce as childish the desire for imaginative fiction.
The questions of whether Esperanto has any place in the science fiction field and whether there is any justification for the modification of the English language for the convenience of the imaginative fiction reader, seem both to be issues on which there can be little in the way of a compromise.
Each man may vote according to his conception of a candidate's character, and hence it comes to pass that councillors well represent the wishes of ratepayers, and, being daily brought in contact with them, they are always en rapport with their requirements and wishes.
Finally, robots, more so than other technology in our lives, have a social valence. They feel different to us, more like living agents.

The incumbent candidate was voted out in a tight race.
Given an integer X written in base 10 (as is usual), compute the sum of the digits of X: call the result the digit sum of X. If the digit sum is greater than 9, we form the digit sum again. Continue in this way to obtain the iterated digit sum which is at most 9.
The digit sum of 517 is 4, since 5 + 1 + 7 = 13 and 1 + 3 = 4.
Every number has a digit sum. The digit sum of 7 is seven. The digit sum of 62 is eight (6 + 2). The digit sum of 728 is also eight (7 + 2 + 8=17, 1 + 7 = 8). The digit sum of a number is found by adding all the digits in the number until a single digit is left.

Light music was especially popular during the formative years of radio broadcasting.
For entirely self-serving reasons, ministers and civil servants never dispelled the public belief that uncaring 'fat cat' privateers or foreign state railways were in control, ramping up fares and creaming off profits which either enriched shareholders or subsidised European rail fares. DfT left train operators to 'take the heat' - which they dutifully did, fearful of speaking up and 'biting the hand that feeds'.
The language we speak is New Zealandese, with its own idiom and pronunciation, and is just as distinctive as the language spoken by Americans, South Africans, Australians and Canadians.

Her appearance, her dress, her manners; what they were pleased to term her "stand-offishness"; her shortcomings as a housekeeper; her ignorance in the matter of mending under-linen; her novel-reading and piano- playing — all these had been toothsome morsels, far more enjoyable than the heavy pies, the thick chops, and the sardines which figured in that horrible Mesopotamian meal known as a "thick tea;" and had been picked to the very bone.
He can read them in a pleasing manner, to his wife and his family, after a five o'clock thick tea, and the reviews will be enriched with the interesting and improving observation made during the perusals.
This was used both at meal-times and for a reading room, breakfasts with tea, dinners, whereat roast-beef and plum-pudding were frequent visitors, "thick teas," and suppers of beer and cheese, supplying the bodily, as a supply of English newspapers satisified the mental appetites of the inmates.
So many informal meals are required during the summer months, whether as light refreshments at tennis parties, or more substantial "thick teas” and “ early suppers,” that a constant change of sweet dishes is desirable.
In fact, this is how lists are actually built, by consing all elements to the empty list, []. The commas-and-brackets notation is just syntactic sugar, a more pleasant way to write code. So [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is exactly equivalent to 1:2:3:4:5:[]. ᵂᴮ
“I need you to draw me a hand turkey for the refrigerator,” my mother said. “Go grab your crayons.”, Sam ran over to his little desk in the corner and started to trace his hand onto a sheet of yellow construction paper.
I’d also whipped a billowing sugary quadruple ration of meringue and set it on top of four vast dishes of buttery crumbs and sharp, homemade lemon custard, and finished the chocolate sponge bases with whipped cream, thickened juices of black cherries and kirch, to make the seventies icon — Black Forest Gâteaux.

[ … ] the spaces that are used in Einstein’s theory are really pseudo-Riemannian and the relevant Morse theory differs in subtle but important ways.
A Möbius strip is a fiber bundle which looks locally (i.e., over a connected proper subset of its base space) like the corresponding part of a cylinder S¹⨯[0,1] (a Möbius strip and a cylinder have isomorphic base spaces). A Klein bottle is a fiber bundle which looks locally like the corresponding part of a torus S¹⨯S¹ (again they could be thought of as sharing the same base space S¹; cutting out even a single point of that base space makes the cut Klein bottle isomorphic to the cut torus).
In general, a fiber bundle consists of a set of mutually disjoint fibers “over” a base space, which indexes the fibers; there is a copy of some fiber on top of, or projecting (“canonically”) onto each point of the base space.
Then I drove the whole lot forth, mother and daughter, lamming into them with fist and foot.
The girl stared at him for a moment thunderstruck; then she lammed into the old horse with a stick she carried in place of a whip.
In the 1960s, some physicists including E. Lubkin and A. Trautman recognized that interaction potentials can be represented by connections on principal fiber bundles. In 1975, T. T. Wu and C. N. Yang used the fiber bundle method to solve a problem on magnetic monopoles.
It's all right. An Englishwoman there lammed into me last night, first about the atom bomb and then saying that I must be a fanatic.
One proposed general model for high-level scientific data uses fiber bundles, which Butler and Pendley [22] proposed in 1989. [ … ] A fiber bundle is the Cartesian product of the fibers and the base space; in other words, it is the collection of valid data ranges for the base space.
(the speaker is a time traveller from the future) Well, lad, I would tell you more, but that's just future history that you must figure out on your own.
Verify that your cases are good law.
Finding the right notion of fiber bundle for diffeology [Igl85] has been a question raised by the study of the irrational torus T_𝛼 [Dolg85].
It has been strongly suggested, however, that the cited cases may no longer reflect good law, particularly when considered in light of the 1984 changes to Section 707(a) governing certain transactions between a partner and a partnership.
My old briefcase is falling apart. I'll have to buy a new one.
Both cases are good law, and if here, the husband were dead, and the title remained in the wife, and the bond was sought to be enforced against her, it would be held invalid.
Before she could reply, he added hastily, “As long as it's not a devil's threesome.” [ … ] “A devil's threesome?”, she asked pointedly. “Let me guess, is that two guys and one girl?” Mason shuddered again and made a face. He nodded.

Having friends that are too much like yourself force you to have a tunnel vision. I believe tunnel vision is a form of blindness. Your span of thinking becomes too narrow, and you close yourself off of so many other great ways of thinking in life.
Originally used of the corners of pages that have become ragged through creasing, "dog eared" is now applied to any pages that have the appearance of heavy use. [ … ] The term is confined mainly to American catalogues; the British prefer "frayed."
But more important than the technology, he says, is what clinicians in the field have taken to calling "webside" manner. It's a modern twist on bedside manner—a physician's ability to relate with a patient and convey their desire to help. […] "Look, there's variation whether you see a clinician in person or whether you see them online, so I'm not saying in any way that telemedicine is less helpful than in-person visits, or that webside manner is worse than bedside manner," says UCSF pulmonologist Adams Dudley. "But webside manner definitely requires more cooperation, and a different kind of cooperation, than bedside manner."

A breaker of green uniforms plunges down the slope of Lime Ridge, curls around sugar bushes and thickets, cascades over stone walls and snake fences, as the Fenians come howling down on them, rifles snapping.
A more refined version is the concept of restless capitalism developed by Metcalfe, working on the evolutionary theory of economic change by Nelson and Winter. In both cases, the economy is in a state of disequilibrium all of the time.
However, until the wheels came off the wagon in 2008, no doubt existed as to the efficacy of Bush's Reaganomics redux in feathering the nests of his wealthy “base.”

The two DJs who I'd seen at that Latics club event turned out to be real grand fromages of the scene, movers, shakers, opinion formers, revered figures.
Grayce had a nursing instructor who “labeled” students and grouped them in unflattering ways. Grayce was put in the “dumb bunny” category.
But when all was said and done, I'd absorbed her belief that a woman was far more attractive, feminine, virtuous, and valuable when supporting and empowering the Grand Fromage, rather than being the Grand Fromage.

Apart from skin colour, I have nothing in common with these Caucasians. To be honest, I have very little in common with the expatriates who live in Singapore either. For a start, most of the ang mohs that live here, particularly the ones from Britain, tend to come from the upper-middle classes.

Wollstonecraft's construction of femininity explicitly challenged the dominant gender ideology of her culture, the concept of the female promoted by conservative and radical thinkers alike, from Burke to Rousseau.
The common bond between women's experience of sport and women's experience of social exclusion is that in both institutions women experience strong discrimination stemming from a pervasive gender ideology.
From the emerging data and based on Hochschild's (1989) delineation, there are three types of gender ideology—traditional, transitional and egalitarian. They can be defined in terms of marital power, expectations of men and women's production role, and expectations of emotional labor.
Although it appears to pursue the good end of honouring all people, it also assumes the whole linguistic fabric of gender ideology, which aims to eliminate the concepts of male and female, dismantle corporal identity and deconstruct the human body, marriage and family.

Statutory exclusion is part of the same trend toward “get-tough” legislation that has shifted decision-making from judges to legislators and prosecutors (Feld, 2000).
Similar to statutory exclusion mechanisms, prosecutorial discretion is often limited to a subset of cases based on age and offense characteristics.
There are two types of actions that do not require extensive NEPA environmental documentation: categorical exclusions and statutory exclusions.
As a result we have both statutory exclusions from patentability and, where the words of the statute are insufficient, judicially derived exclusions.

You have to give director Colm McCarthy, a Scottish TV veteran making his feature film debut, and writer Mike Carey, adapting his own novel, credit for attempting the seemingly impossible task of doing something new with the zombie subgenre.

The dim-wits hardly realize that they come pretty close to accusing God of advocating ritual murder, when they use the Biblical story to prove the “original sin” of the Jews.

The debate over the right terms and conditions for Britain’s departure from the European Union is often simplified into two clashing concepts: a soft Brexit and a hard one.

And can bits of both be combined to some degree?

Historical, cultural and institutional attributes influenced Scandinavian political choices for social insurance institutions and welfare policies at the time of the Bismarckian 'conception' of national social insurance on a grand scale in the 1880s.
The original Social Security Act (1935) and the current version of the Act, as amended, encompass several social welfare and social insurance programs.

As his screen displayed the falling and fragmenting wreckage of two aircraft that had collided at 2,650 ft. three miles northeast of Lindbergh Field, he muttered, "Jesus Christ, an aluminum shower."
To complicate things, in stick frog, one had to hold onto his right ear with his left hand and hold the knife in his right hand while extending his right hand through the loop formed by his left with one toss.
Certainly one of the most stressful jobs in contemporary society is that of the air traffic controller. . . . This pressure, combined with the ever-present fear of causing a crash or collision (known with studied casualness as an "aluminum shower"), places controllers under tremendous stress on the job.
One would scarcely think of hardening a quill in order to enable it to compete with a steel nib in some of the least desirable qualities, though one often wishes one could accomplish the reverse process, and soften or supple a steel stick frog so as to give it the elasticity of the grey goose quill.
In the daytime her adult students earned their living in the market as vendors of mosquito coils, toilet paper, batteries, flashlights, tiger balms.
John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton play two air-traffic controllers who are prickly and complex. . . . They use cynicism to protect themselves from the terrors of the job. One guy "has an aluminum shower in his future".
Deb actually felt sorry for her then, in spite of everything. But she also wanted to get out of there, away from the smells of burning rubbish and fish sauce and tiger balm; away from Luke's mum.
But he agrees that corporate jets are increasing the strain on air traffic controllers trying to prevent what’s known in the industry as an “aluminum shower,” a midair collision.
It is common for straying spouses to discharge or unload information after carrying around secrets for months, sometimes years. [ … ] It is uncommon for them to be completely honest upon the first disclosure, for they tend to withhold details and only reveal the absolute minimum to protect themselves.

SAC made a big deal about getting everywhere the B-52's flew exactly on time. . . . [I]f you were late and the next aircraft scheduled in was early there was an increased possibility of an aluminum shower.
A delightful evening was spent Wednesday, May 27th, when an aluminum shower was given to Miss Alice Strycker at her home, 1907 Baker Street, San Francisco, to celebrate her approaching marriage.
The aluminum shower appears to be very popular, but one should ascertain first whether or not the bride-to-be wants aluminum in her kitchen.
Just calm down. There's no point getting steamed up about it.
A lovely kitchen show was given her by her sister, Evelyn Van Dyke, and an aluminum shower by Dorothy Kroone and Alice Parks Messmore. She received many lovely gifts and a good time is reported by all.
If they make 2 hearts they will score 60 points below the line but as this is the first hand of the game they will not have already made another part score.
He nodded his assent with his face buried in her cunt lips, smeared from brow to chin with girl juice.
The Office of Production Management, the OPM, has directed the Office of Civilian Defense to conduct an "Aluminum Shower". In other words, we are to collect all the available old aluminum in order to turn it over to the Government.
William S. Knudsen, director-general of O. P. M., has advised General R. B. Rathbun, director of the Minneapolis aluminum shower committee, to leave no possible source of scrap aluminum untouched because of the "critical shortage"
She saw me right enough (= so she can't pretend she did not)
This is now much reviled as a symbol of Western meddling in the Middle East and, right enough, it appears to have been yet another of those fantasies that arose out of the First World War.
Most of you remember the "aluminum shower" which the American housewives gave Uncle Sam about eight months ago. Well, the Office of Emergency Management has been trying to find out what happened to all the pots and pans

"You seem to have a lot to say," remarked Silver, spitting far into the air. "Pipe up and let me hear it, or lay to."
Whether it be the terror of salafi jihadism or the insidious institutional racism of the British National Party, there are those who stand ready to fill the vacuum with a sanitised identity and twisted vision if the silent majority hold back from forging a new identity.
When people see puppies going for the cost of vaccinations at animal shelters, and then hear about ones that sell for $500, they think big money is to be had in dog breeding.
Once I asked a seventeen-year-old singer something that wasn't on the list, which caused her manager to pipe up: "That wasn't what we agreed on. She doesn't have to answer that."
To oversimplify a bit[…]the [Bernie] Sanders view is that money is the root of all evil. Or more specifically, the corrupting influence of big money, of the 1 percent and the corporate elite, is the overarching source of the political ugliness we see all around us.
As we rolled into our fourth week, I found myself piping up with some of my own stories.
The progressive wing of the Democratic Party is skeptical: The Republican Party has gone authoritarian. Mitch McConnell is obstructionist. Big money pulls the strings. The system is broken.
Unless their candidates can amass a considerable campaign chest, one assumed to come from big money donors, they do not stand a chance of winning.
[T]he frogs in a neighboring marsh began to pipe up for the evening concert.
The Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies school (yuanyang hudie pai; henceforth Butterfly) has its origins in the mid-1910s boom in commercial periodicals.
But presently the gray dawn stole over the world, the birds piped up, then the sun rose and poured light and comfort all around.
Wei Shaochang's Yuanyang hudie offers a quite thorough collection of material.
However, this paper stands mostly on the side of traditional-style popular urban fiction also known as yuanyang hudie. Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School.
Once, for ten minutes, the sun shone at midday, and ten minutes afterward a new gale was piping up.
Bad loans on bank balance sheets reflect that millions of people have lost jobs, eliminating spending power, while companies have seen sales evaporate.
Yet beyond turning my blood cold for a moment, it gave me little trouble, for evil tales have hung about the church; and though I did not set much store by the old yarns of Blackbeard piping up his crew, yet I thought strange things might well go on among the graves at night. And so I never budged, nor stirred hand or foot to save a fellow-creature in his agony.
Peas likely came ashore in the New World with the earliest English and French explorers and spread along with the colonies. Thomas Jefferson has a nearly mythical association with garden peas.
We will also discuss our goal of continually advancing web search to next level by applying data mining, machine learning, and knowledge discovery techniques into the process of information analysis, organization, retrieval, and visualization.
Francis Urquhart: Got anything on him?, Tim Stamper: There was a whiff of scandal about ten years ago., Francis Urquhart: Rent boy. In a train. To Red Hill. Yes. Wanted to sell his story but we bought it and hushed him up. Be ungentlemanly to bring that up. A man's private life should be private., Tim Stamper: On the other hand, getting sucked off in second class is hardly prime ministerial behaviour., Francis Urquhart: Yes, you have a point there.
Some relationships that can get you to your next level are partnerships. Joining forces with other women or with men can help to bring your vision into fruition even earlier.

Cousin to the road warrior who travels frequently on business, the corridor warrior spends his or her time running from meeting to meeting, apparently with no life beyond the conference room.
It was a show flat. The living room windows have a heavy curtain. The bathroom does not have an outside window. There is no glass in the front door.
A show flat was built in the premises of the school run by the mediating NGO. For the DDA engineer interviewed, the show flat was a way to explain the housing project to Kathputli Colony's residents. The explanations provided by a manager from the private firm stressed another point: the purpose of the show flat was to present it to the DDA for its approval, and not to elicit residents' views.
So put on your favourite tunes and throw some shapes.

Her cathead biscuits were at least three inches in diameter and two inches thick. The trick to eating catheads was to get the butter on them before they got cold—then they were delicious. When, unluckily, they were allowed to get cold, they tended to a gooeyness, not unlike a wad of tired gum.
Seeing her car keys, she grabbed the chain, finding her switch blade.
One day a saint, wandering in the vicinity in search of drinking water, fainted. As he regained his senses, he could hear the trickle of water running from the Pot. He drank his fill and since then the spring has never gone dry.
In each boot was a small knife, in her left pocket was a pocket knife, taped to her right wrist was a switch blade, and holstered to her shoulder was a dagger.
It seems unlikely that the ancient Maya would have ventured into Actun Pech in search of drinking water when it could have been more easily and regularly procured from local wells. Rather, the water collected from Actun Pech and other caves discussed below, was likely valued for its remote and sacred origin.

Special mention has to go to 'I need your loving', the opening track on side 2 which appears to be a Phil-fronted remix of 'What have you done for me lately' made famous by Janet, the aforementioned 'Queen of wardrobe malfunctioners and extra special mention to the lowest point on the album, and probably also their careers, the atrocious 'Swang'.
In other words, she was a serial wardrobe malfunctioner (If there is such a term. And even if there isn't, now that I've invented it, there is).
John O'Hara kept his appointment in Samarra Saturday at the age of 65, and even though I am aware that the Black Hawks are romping toward a Stanley Cup triumph and the Cubs are opening at home tomorrow and the world's greatest golfers are concluding an epic struggle over Augusta National's picturesque acres, I'm going to devote this column to John O'Hara because I think I owe it to him.

He'd suddenly felt hot under the collar, having thought back to when Larry had so nearly been closer than anyone in finding out their secret; for it really had been far too close for comfort back there at the office, when he and Larry had met Anne outside the women's toilets, and she having been confronted by us, had suddenly become a quickly blushing, red-faced lady, almost as if she'd been seen in a state of undress, particularly when Larry had asked her what she'd been up to, meaning work that day!
Cornbread was on the table at each meal, but it was cooked in different ways: dog bread, milk bread, pone bread, fried bread, molasses bread, and clabber bread, which has a sour taste. The dog bread was put on the table each morning six days a week, cooked in a round cast-iron pan and cut like a pie to serve each person at the table.
After the party, John let me doss down on the living-room floor.
I guess the "dog bread" Miss Dora threw into the backyard was too great a treat to walk out on. She made it with hot water instead of milk and it was crusty and brown.

The best things for dogs are meat — cooked, but a little raw meat at times does the dog good; hominy, dog bread, biscuits, bread, gravy, and in short everything you would eat yourself with the exception of potatoes and sweets. Do not eat dog bread yourself — you might grow a tail and bark.
Hedge funds head for the final frontier

In another preliminary study, with a segment of the triple energizer meridian on the lower arm selected as reference segment, core resistance-based rofiles around the lower arm showed three of the other five meridians to exist as local resistance minima relative to neighboring nonmeridian segments.
The moving qi between the kidneys starts at qi hai; the triple warmer meridian receives it and sends it up to the head and into the brain.

It is in this latter section that we will explore the close relationship between hybridity and the concept of the Third Space, which emerges as a major conceptual tool in understanding how hybridity works.
This space within the Trinity corresponds to another space—the Third Space conjectured by postcolonial theory. The Third Space is a location in which community and identity are negotiated and where postcolonial subjects can enter into discourse not bound to the typical boundaries of colonizing discourse.
It uses the simplest time table in the world--a train is always just pulling out as you get to the platform.
You can purchase one of the numerous cleaners on the market specifically formulated to dissolve soap scum or use a variety of home remedies for ridding tile, showers and bathtubs from the dull gray film.
He knew there wasn't anything I liked better than a coney island and a strawberry Nehi.
Bars made of real soap (sodium salts of fatty acids) are still very popular products for showering and whole body bathing, however, and using these products will produce soap scum. It is interesting to speculate on whether soap scum becomes less of a problem as use of shower gels continues to increase.
The effects of transcranial direct current stimulation are modified when combined with medication and other neurostimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

I would lie in bed listening to the tugs hooting; I would wake up to find my painter's great north windows awash with foggy sea light.
A large square porthole let in the sea light, but this didn't make much difference: The moment Wilson stepped through the hatchway with Ackerman's daily mound of food in hand, he recognized it immediately—the plastic closeness, the pale, powdery smell of offices.
As there is a dangerous sand bar at the mouth of the harbor, these lights serve as useful guides, and also as sea lights. (1809.)

In European settings, tax resistance stopped being a collective form of protest in the nineteenth century, when connections among representation, citizenship, and taxation were affirmed.
Some level of tax resistance must be expected under any system of public policy. But if popular support of and confidence in government is constant, tax resistance also should be constant.

The difficulties which arise when universal coinage schemes are brought forward ought not to conceal from us the solid advantages which such an institution would confer on the world... The question of mint pars would no longer arise, and the specie points would be stated more simply.
The latest Stripes album title, a play on the Lancastrian exclamation Ecky thump! is, in part, a gasp of surprise...
We find that the rates at which one currency will exchange for another fluctuate between two limits on each side of the Mint Par, marking the points at which it becomes more profitable to send or to receive gold rather than to send or receive a credit instrument. These theoretical limits are known as the gold points.

While some have begun to define the concept of third space, the ever-changing nature of third space theory is a constant roadblock for scholars in this area.
It is the lived condition of crossing borders and existing in the realm of both/and together that allows for the conscious movement into the creative terrain of third space.

The council environment enforcement services manager, John MacLachlan, said the proposal appeared to satisfy most of the immediate amenity concerns, and that adverse effects on the environment would be minor. “For example, the impact on identified view shafts is not a factor.”
In contrast to it, however, the under-scaled entrance, the playful use of geometric shapes and the unexpected glimpses of bustling activity provided by narrow view shafts added the humanist qualities that Beaven so particularly valued.

The curious ant-eaters (earth pigs and pangolins) are probably relics of an earlier fauna, which have survived owing to their nocturnal habits.
He may be thought inconsistent, and even so he is.
Aardvarks also eat ants. African natives kill aardvarks to eat. But these “earth pigs” are not easy to catch. Although they look clumsy, they can run fast. They can bury themselves in the ground fast, too.
Bahuchet (1985), who researched the Aka living in Central Africa, cites the earth pig, flying squirrel, and leopard as examples of avoided food animals.
What a strange thing, I mused, was this smoking, that takes a man suddenly, be he in the court, the camp, or the grove, grips him like an Afreet, and whirls him off to do its imperious behests! Would it be even so with myself, I wondered, in those unknown grown-up years to come?

bit bucket – the term for a routine or circuit that accepts binary signals and produces no output. Bit buckets are used for testing and to stand in for routines or circuits that have not been implemented at that particular point.
Instead, here she was, a woman who had only been cheated on in the past, abandoned by her father, and for that, her heart was signed, sealed, and delivered to only her.
Inside the computer, every time a byte moves from one component to another the hardware performs a parity check by counting the number of ones. … But let's say a power surge or some other line noise is picked up by the computer and the byte is scrambled. … The errant byte, having failed the parity test, is unceremoniously dumped into the bit bucket, the computer's wastepaper basket.
Methodism, in contrast to these sects, was based on a strict division of causes of symptoms into three conditions of the body: status laxus, in which the body or affected part is lax and wet, leading for example to a flux; status strictus, a constricted and dry state, of which amenorrhea was seen as a case in point; and status mixtus, a combination in which some parts of the body are constricted and others lax.
Galen, for the status mixtus gives the example of an inflammation of the eye with discharge: the inflammation itself is a case of constriction whereas the discharge indicates relaxation.
An alternative is for the automated spacecraft to assume that tracking is always available and to have the spacecraft take its data and return it accepting that some fraction of the time communication will in fact not be available. Science data would then go into the "bit bucket." Since current spacecraft are complex and expensive, the latter solution is rarely used (intentionally!) today.

When a packet arrives, the first thing that is done is a cyclic redundancy check …. If the CRC does not match the one carried in the frame, then the packet is destroyed (sent to the "Bit Bucket" in Figure 16.1).
In that beautiful spirit we say: Merry Krismos — may every home in Belize have a ham and turkey, a batl pahn table, black cake and rum popo for the gentle folk, and a special gift for the little ones.
The flan ($8) was milky and smooth, and the optional rum popo — a rum crème that’s similar to egg nog — gave it a little kick.
In [John] Watkinson's view, all recording should be done in non-specific "bit buckets," with a computer figuring out what got recorded where and when.
The first drink I ever learned how to make was a Rum Popo,
Shifting the contents of the register one bit to the right places a zero in the leftmost bit location and discards the rightmost bit. Conversely, a left-shift pads the rightmost bit with a zero and the upper, leftmost bit falls off into the "bit bucket".
Called originally 'kùsa-scythe' and later "sudlice," it doubled as both a stabbing and cutting weapon, developing later into the "ušata sudlice" — Bohemian earspoon, more suitable for combat — thanks to side spikes (ears), acting as end stops, [as a result of which] it did not penetrate too deep.

In the afternoon, he will depart for Castel Gandolfo, the summer residence of popes, where he will remain until restorations are complete on the Vatican convent where he will live out his days.
In the standard fix-price model of price-taking competitive firms, Keynesian and classical unemployment are separate states according to whether notional product supply exceeds or falls short of market demand at the prevailing wage and price configuration, so that labor demand is either output constrained and determined by the inverted production function (Keynesian unemployment), or firms are on their notional product supply and labor demand functions but the real wage exceeds the Walrasian full-employment level (classical unemployment). Thus labor demand is independent of the real wage in the Keynesian state and depends only on the real wage in the classical state.
Classical unemployment is the result of real wages being above their market clearing level leading to an excess supply of labour.
The real question, I think, is not whether the field as a whole is in any real danger of another AI winter but, rather, whether progress remains limited to narrow AI or ultimately expands to Artificial General Intelligence as well.
"My old roommate Erin Lee and I were first taught stone mulching by Ruth Hanner up in her Köke'e garden on Kaua'i. She had been taught this technique as a young farmer's wife in Peru."
John F. Williams, Paul Clifford. low rate, on the other hand may mean that the legal department is an "elephants' graveyard," from which no escape is possible.
In experiments, stone mulching decreases soil water evaporation, protects against wind and rain erosion, and reduces daily temperature fluctuation.
I suppose every garden has one: an elephants' graveyard of discarded labels.
Gore, of course, has never been a political Boy Scout, least of all when it comes to campaign finance.
On D-Day the allied armies had more than 150,000 men under arms.
When he arrived in Washington, some people thought of him as a Boy Scout, perhaps because he wore his hair in a crew cut.
The dull grey skies hint at more snow, and the zero chill approaches.
You'd better run like hell!
The deep, killing cold eased, although she knew somehow that the zero chill was only held at bay.
As the carbon equivalent increases, the depth of the chill decreases until the entire sample is gray, showing a zero chill measurement.
He had an innate honesty and humility, a work ethic that elevated him above most others in England. He knew what he wanted and worked like hell to try to make it happen.
Chill depth in the castings poured with inoculant inserts was greatly reduced, and some of them (e.g. castings 35, 38) had the optimum combination of zero chill and low dross.

But the practices governing the giving of ang paos defy simplification, and I heard only recently — in a Hokkien family — of a married daughter giving an ang pao to her parents, although they were by then grandparents many times over.
They did not have the ang pao culture, the “red-envelope” culture.
"Proud to make the acquaintance of your Dukeness," I said, hastily swallowing a quantity of tobacco-juice.
So the photographers who were there when the people raised their hands snapped the picture, and it came out with everybody raising his hands for the great ang pau from the Prime Minister who, at that particular time, was the Chairman and members of the Singapore Harbour Board all rolled into one.
He took a leap of faith by publishing his first book independently.
Cedric Tan, a Baba whose home is in Malacca, provides details of a Peranakan family's preparations that go far beyond these general statements, including lighting lanterns, saying prayers, lighting candles and joss sticks, paying homage to elders, exchanging ang pau (red packets with money inside), visiting a nearby temple, delivering delicacies to neighbors, and even visiting family graves.
Sorry, love. I got stuck in your dirty pillows.
Don't you want to take a leap of faith? Or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone?
"A bit of a Fulham virgin, eh?"¶ "She will be, unless she finds well, someone."
Considering that the GBR proposal is supported by DfT (which would lose considerable power) with the support of the Treasury (which will have to make a major leap of faith), those critics need to frame their complaints very carefully if we are to avoid yet worse problems.
Until recently, London has had only one building that works by way of a euphemism for bumming. Yes — the Oxo Tower on the South Bank has been the sole venue to allow people to post Facebook update statuses such as: 'First date with Grace last night. I took her up the Oxo Tower.'
This was not a printer's devilry, for taffetas, sugar, mats are similarly misstated.

What is that which is a friend and an enemy, a blessing and a curse, which saves life and takes it away; is long and short, round and square, rough and smooth, straight and crooked, hard and soft, hot and cold, and most wanted when it is in greatest plenty; which accommodates itself to all palates; is sweet and of bad smell, strong and weak; sometimes able to bear great burdens, but at other times will not bear a pin.
On the whole the Contrabando was both a blessing and a curse; it was a blessing and a great benefit in that it brought the necessities of life to the people, but a curse in that it was training them in intrigue, because the contrabandistas often resorted to piracy along the sequestered coasts and on the open seas; they would sell their commodities to the people, then turn around and loot the cattle and hogs in the fields.
Could you please buy me an iced tea from the machine?
'Thanks to your natural curls you will never have to have a Marcel perm or a Eugene wave, think of that.’
To me, the bassoon is the greatest of the double reeds.

In a culture where male victimhood is stigmatised as feminine and weak (toxic masculinity is, above all, an extension of misogyny), believing male victims isn’t oppositional to feminism, it is a feminist imperative.
This, of course, is hoary nonsense, as there is a long and ignoble history of Christian-identified men, caught up in the cult of toxic masculinity, sowing discord and causing violence in our country.
Royal Mail worker Evette Chapman gathered a team of 12 colleagues to deliver post in fancy dress and raise money for a nurses' charity and patients in Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton.
This impression is underscored by the high level of minority representation in our major team sports.
But he was required to do a team sport, so he compromised by choosing track, which ironically involved the biggest team of the season.
And I looked forward to the other nine games of the greatest team sport devised by man.
In addition to personality differences between athletes and non-athletes, personality differences were also observed between team sport athletes and individual sport athletes.
The representational aspect of team sport adds to this.
What do you think will happen to a regime, that has caused so many folks to be harmed with sexual violence, among other things?
Look, I had a pressure cooker of a job along with more responsibility that any one person should have. I had an office of twenty-five people under me all needing help like little birds in a nest.
The Herald published a fictitious story of a zoo break, accompanied by pictures of elephants, donkeys, lions and other brothers of the menagerie.
Humanity lives in a pressure cooker of stress because of the ruthless way in which we compete, because of our lack of respect for the international rules of commerce, because of social conflicts, because of the devastation to the environment.
In one of these scenes, Siggy must run for his life, and goes back to Vienna to plan the zoo break.
Between 1718 and 1775, the empire transported about fifty thousand felons, more than half of all English emigrants to America during that period. The transported were overwhelmingly young, unmarried men with little or no economic skill: the cannon fodder of war and the jail fodder of peace.

I was one of the only soldiers out there wearing hearing protection; all the rest just went commando.
The election has now come and gone, full of sound and fury, signifying how much more than nothing, no one is yet sure as recounts are done while the fractured mainstream media (MSM) pontificates, and the alt left and right variants mutter in the Internet shadows.
But when you have a radical alt left fool appointing radical alt left judges who put radical political agendas above the law, this is what you get.
Does this mean you shouldn’t bother setting a password on your network? Absolutely not — WPA/WPA2 are still much better options than WEP or going commando, but it's important to realize that these “protected” setups aren't bulletproof.
Those human laws, that annex a punishment to it, do not at all increase it’s moral guilt, or superadd any fresh obligation in foro conscientiae to abstain from it’s perpetration.
It may even be a minority of one. I carry my phone around just the way the deities made it. It happens to be an iPhone, but I'd feel just the same about a Samsung Galaxy -- especially the Edge series, which strikes me as quite beautiful. Is there no way you can let your phone go commando?
When you want to learn how to use a specific piece of gear, such as a new lens, or master a specific technique, I advise that you go commando. When you go commando, you take just enough gear to master the technique you want to learn or only the lens with which you want to become more familiar.
Coding Horror author Jeff Atwood believes, “One of the quickest ways to increase your productivity on the computer is to go commando: stop using the mouse.”
There is a remarkable painting of a galante of the time of Edward IV, in the Hungerford chapel in the cathedral of Salisbury [ … ] in which the hose is continued from the shoe to the waist without any sign of gartering at the knee, all of one piece.

A few hours before sundown we camped at a small playa lake sunk beneath the level of the grass.
She continued along the bar ditch, sweat running down her back now.
There's something special about tidal estuaries, due to the abundance of wildlife and the ever-changing scenes as the water ebbs or rises. Throw in some moody skies and filtered sunlight, and the views can resemble a painting by Turner - only you don't have to go to the National Gallery to see this, it's brought to your seat on a train.
As “liquid bread” (see Schiefenhovel and Macbeth 2011), the nutritional benefits of beer are commendable, with barley-beer containing more B vitamins and the essential amino acid lysine than barley bread.
Kid, I like women too, but not that way. You need time to get acquainted, drink a little, talk a little. In the cat wagon you got to get it over with and out in five minutes, no time to button your pants.
There was an uproad from the fire-eaters, who imagined they were fighting for human dignity and freedom from the northern elite, but more cat wagons were requisitioned and the complaining stopped.

Unless there be some lesion of the stomach, there is no blood, either microscopic or occult.
It is so easy to fool the reader with the pseudo realistic and the pseudo analytical.
There ought to be representation on the broad basis of population and public discussion with open doors and free debate. . . . Nor should there be any constraint upon the opinions of any of the members of the Diet or upon their right of publishing them, even though such would meet with opposition from without.
The analytical model of the structure, and several pseudo analytical models, can serve as the basis for updating.
The pump [of the steam fire-engine], being at the forward end, was made of gun metal and was double acting, having eight brass suction-valves, four on each side, and four discharge valves, opening into the air vessels, to which a double discharge valve, having one opening on the inside and two on the outside, was attached for the purpose of using two lines of hose.

This expulsion measure was used in 1931 against the Communist Party branch in Durban, which was at the forefront of the burning of passes: Gana Makabeni was endorsed out 'to his home in the Transkei'.
The heavy machinery industry of China, including the manufacture of iron and steel plant, rolling mill, heavy—duty forging and pressing machinery, large forgings and castings, etc., developed along a hard and tortuous road from small products to huge ones, from single machines to complete plants after the birth of New China.
Completion of the railroad allowed heavy machinery to be brought to the mine, including a 40-meter rotary kiln.

At one time they were twenty-four in number; but Holland (1812) and Hughes (1814) found them reduced to ten; at Curzon's visit (1834) there were only seven; and in 1853 not more than four of these were inhabited by more than two or three monks. Meteora par excellence is the largest and perhaps the most ancient.
The histologic picture of dermatopathic lymphadenitis may be associated with a variety of benign skin disorders, and occasionally lesions similar to dermatopathic lymphadenitis are noted in patients without apparent skin lesions.
This is the age of invention, most certainly—the age, one may say—the age par excellence.
Follicular lymphoid hyperplasia is present in the early stages of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, and smears show LHAs, a polymorphous lymphocyte population, and variable numbers of Figure 7.8.
Indeed, in the present study, IDC of dermatopathic lymphadenopathies expressed these five markers, whereas the majority of normal intraepidermal LC did not.
The mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.
Soloff (1941) emphasized the difficulty in distinguishing histologically between some cases of lipomelanic reticulosis and Hodgkin's disease.
The red pill – while hinting that Simpson might become Nuke in the Marvel universe – seems in this context to function also as an obvious reference to “red pillers”, men’s rights activists who see themselves as proud anti-feminists interested in dominance, traditional gender roles, and the subjugation of women, whose flaws make that subjugation necessary.
Instead "red pillers" believe in a shared delusional system in which "Feminazis" and "Social Justice Warriors" have taken over the world.
Those requirements are apparently daunting to “red pillers.”

...into this fuck truck she came, seamy with semen, a place that made a motel whorehouse seem as fresh as new grass.
One of the areas that were most concentrated on at DI School was close order drill.
We had an hour's close-order drill every day, using the drills of the thirties, and if Prazenka didn't like the way we did them, he'd turn back to the old field manual (which read, "Close-order drill is the foundation of all discipline") and throw another hour's worth on top of us.
'Shame, it's nicknamed the "fuck truck".' 'Flic, I didn't go to Oz to get laid!' 'What was it you were saying before you left?'
Man, we've done so much close-order drill and manual-of-arms that I think we could do it in our sleep.
They did not wait the two months granted, but made a quick decision and picked up bag and baggage, and after leaving four Fathers to care for the Catholics, left on carts and on foot for Antwerp.
To account for the exigencies of terrain, extended order drill was practised on different types of ground in platoon, company, or battalion-sized formations.
Coming to the Fourteenth Pennsylvania he required them to go through certain movements in the extended order drill which not being done entirely to his satisfaction, he sent his orderly to the commanding officer of the Ninth Battalion, requesting him to have his command on the drill ground at once.
With bag and baggage, they, along with about six hundred other servicemen of various US Forces, were herded into olive drab military buses and transported to San Francisco, where their ship was waiting, the USNS General Walker.
Just as in war, we have the analogy of extended-order drills, combat exercises, and field exercises, all of which it is best to follow by "a brief drill at attention in order to restore smartness and control."
I could go from valley to valley and from hill to hill; I could “bring up” when it was necessary; and when my labours were finished in one place, I could go on, bag and baggage, to another.
But it was not all clear sailing. When Mandel wrote Mrs. Roosevelt on March 18, 1941, exposing the China Aid Committee as a Communist front, she wrote back, “I do not understand what you are trying to bring to my attention.
The summer camp was being dismantled, and the tribe, bag and baggage, was preparing to go off to the fall hunting.
This likelihood did not mean, however, that 1938 brought clear sailing for Senate bill 5.
In early February the North China Marines arrived, bag and baggage, decked out with full uniforms, overcoats and fur-lined hats.
[ … ] I don't propose to stand by and see you, Jordan, and your friend take all the risk. Anybody can do what you ask him to do – go into that jewelry store, ask to look at some diamonds, and, when these are shown, make a snatch and run out of the store.]
While the mandarins in this recipe are amazingly healthy little packages of antioxidants and polymethoxylated flavonesxxvii, the refined sugar content makes these cupcakes a sometimes food.
[I]t was doubtful if even the 50% discount that has prevailed for several years could be continued in view of the increasing number of so-called “snatch and run” losses on grade floor premises—few, if any, of which are prevented by burglar alarm systems.
In 2005, it was reported that Cookie Monster would start eating a more healthful diet. Instead of his signature song, “C is for Cookie”, he would now sing “Cookie is a Sometimes Food.”
Yes, it's a 'sometimes food' and when executed properly it will bring on a devilish cheeky grin that ought to be reserved for other naughtiness.
A fine example of this type of situation can be drawn from the US experience in Somalia were locals had perfected the "snatch and run." Crowds of up to 300 thieves would swarm military vehicles, slowed by strategically placed roadblocks, and snatch both personal gear and weapons before disappearing into the crowd.
A decision to go nuclear has important adverse diplomatic repercussions as well. Trying to build a nuclear arsenal is not the way to win friends in the international community.

Supposing now that some of them were to slip into the boat at night and cut the cable, and make off with her? That would be a pretty go, that would.
Years ago, the sport spread from New Zealand to Australia—and went nuclear. Overnight, it seemed, Australia boasted 40 tracks, which were promptly divided into several warring factions.
We had but euen pot luck, a little to moyſten our lips, and no more.
But the fever pitch went nuclear when the Ramones took the stage.
“They don’t want to deal with this,” Ms. Lalich said. “It’s going to have to go nuclear, using the Insurrection Act and bringing out the military.”
/mode/1up page 30: A pretty way to conciliate ‘little tempers’ indeed, to add to the offence of spoiling the fish the crime of bringing an unexpected friend to eat it. Pot luck, quotha, when the pot's boiled over this half hour!
We had a patrol from Item Co. out in the valley between Pork Chop and Chink land.
But he never contradicted Mrs Hackit—a woman whose "pot luck" was always to be relied on, and who on her side had unlimited reliance on bleeding, blistering, and draughts.
We stopped for coffee au lait near the old French Market, took a walk out to the levee and then back to the Court of the Three Sisters to sit out under the trees, drink beer and talk fencing until the moon began to yawn.

Other grasses include bunny grass and variegated varieties.
Dwarf fountain grass, bunny grass, and deer grass are beautiful, hardy companions to the conifer garden.
Eugene O'Neill, in his 1914 play, The Movie Man, coined a memorable simile: "We sure are as nutty as a fruitcake or we wouldn't be here."
Using cellophane bunny grass, particularly the iridescent kind, is an effective way to give the impression of splashing water.

A button fell off my coat.
Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet. For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert.
He wants them to pack their stuff on their boats and sail back to chink land.
Business always falls off in the winter.
“Christ doesn't he know that jacket has been out of style since Chubby Checker?” One asked. “Maybe it's still popular in chink land".
Fair was Eutelidas once, with his beautiful hair, But admiring his face in the stream, on himself he inflicted A dread fascination, and wasted away with disease.
MC ___'s new album is wack - he's fallen off big-time.
The Etruscans, said to be the most ancient people of whom we have any preserved records in Europe, were evidently, like most primaeval races, strong believers in a future state, and took great pains to protect their dead; we may even suggest that precaution, lest the dread fascination should injure the bodies of their helpless departed, may have led to burning them, and thus we arrive at the ultimate origin of cremation, certainly not the earliest method of disposal of the dead.
What he liked to call helpful, however, was more like Gwen's idea of controlling and manipulative. Potayto, potahto, and don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.
Her heart beat so fast that it nearly stified her; she stared in dread fascination at that spectral figure, which was Hugo and yet which was not Hugo, for the face was pale and transparent, the eyes shone strangely — he looked altogether unearthly.
It appears to be in that strange mental condition which most of ourselves must often enough have experienced in the case of dreams — a kind of dread fascination, which enchains all the mental faculties, and causes, as it were, a failure of the faculties of the brain.
"In Common Lisp (and presumably Emacs Lisp), functions are as first-class as in Scheme and elsewhere. You just have to do a bit extra to use them as first-class values, that's all." Potayto, potahto. That 'bit extra' is what makes them 'not first-class denotable' in my book.
We watched in dread fascination as he skipped lightly down the steps.
We can also see that one element in crime fiction always remains the same: our dread fascination for the unknown, for the darker side of human nature, and the everpresent phantom of danger.
We need not take certain events, particularly concerning his father, Max, and his mother's religiosity, quite so far as Arthur Mitzman in order to recognize Weber's dread fascination with the role played in some bourgeois personalities by ultimate, absolutistic values and otherwise irrational vectors.
Eggie, who cursed me for my dread fascination with churches, spires, and cathedrals, and such, ordered to hold my head straight as he sketched a neutral diagram of me under a violet ruby cross in the wuthering light, joking a bit that I looked like a weathered fat lady that was floating in mid-air.
Their take-home pay was half their gross, but fifteen percent was for retirement.
The quicksort algorithm is an example of divide and conquer.
He was commended for his work, and there is no suggestion that if he had eschewed all coat trailings his success would have been greater.
The meander in the river had been become incised as a result of tectonic uplift.
It took a full month and a half of his smooth talk, a few pieces of expensive jewelry and some very fine coke to get her in his bed.
We went down a flight of fifteen steps below the ground level, and stood in a small chapel tricked out with tapestry hangings, silver lamps, and oil paintings.
This they did, Paul says, when by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
He was tricked out in his best: an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.
A combination of subtle pressure and smooth talking can make you feel that you are somehow either out of line or missing out on something great if you want to take it at a pace you are comfortable with.
I was lower than low in the face of a reality that none of my usual resourcefulness or smooth talking could erase or make better.
That stare was as if he saw her—a doll tricked out in garments labelled soul, spirit, rights, responsibilities, dignity, freedom—all so many words.
But it was my mother's decision to take me to a psychiatrist as a young child for "selective mutism", (a period of time without talking to certain people in my case) after a smooth talking cousin attempted to do things with me on the old farm, and I was not informed of those things as children are today.
His friends were particularly impressed with the way he tricked out his Ruckus.
Even with an elephant dose of sedative, the horse was still kicking at him when he tried to clean the wound.

It used to be a pleasant little community, until the leaders sold out to the developers.
For a good candidate for the 2016 Presidential election, why not Zoidberg?

The loop was more than twice as fast after I had applied peephole optimization.
“In your mind, whether you want to or not, you immediately start to say goodbye and just make final (arrangements) just to grandkids, your neighbors and all that,’’ she said of learning of her diagnosis. “But hope has floated at me from every angle at West Jefferson.’’
They are out of town this week.
This brings us at last to game day. You are going to speak. You are prepared to speak, but you still have some work to do before, during, and right after your presentation.
Thanks to my wonderful team at Brigham and Women's and the awesome folks at the Pulmonary Rehab Department at Concord Hospital, Concord, New Hampshire, as the “game day” approached; it actually looked like I could make it.
They look like they are from out of town.
This is the first big area that will be hit and conditions will arrive in just a few hours. This is game day. This is going to hit.
It's the kind of Manhattan place you take your relatives when they come from out of town.
Rafferty was a florid public speaker and aspiring demagogue who emerged from what even a conservative like William Rusher described as “the fever swamp of rightist kookery in southern California.
The neoconservatives, who only a few years before had been denouncing the far-right conservatism of "the fever swamps" (Midge Decter's term), had caught a bad case of far-right fever themselves.
Oh, I ain't gotta ask I can tell you ain't from here-here-here-here / [ … ] / If you know, you know I like that / Out of town girl, girl, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
It is worth it, before making a final comment on the grander points involved, to climb out of the polemical fever swamps and look with a little detachment on the purely economic question.
But as there is a double motion of the stars, that is, under the primum mobile, and round the world, by both which, as we have said, they influence, we must consequently suppose, that the significators rule over things subjected to them by this twofold (or double) motion, to wit, under the primum mobile, and round the world.
This isn’t intended to be a “get off my lawn!” argument, though it is indeed old-fashioned to believe everyone deserves respect.
But putting aside the throwaway “most admired woman” line, this has got to be the most “get off my lawn” tweet I have ever seen in my life.
A primum mobile, therefore, being essential to the celestial mechanism, the same may be proved geometrically to originate in a solar repulsion, or in a repulsive force produced by whatsoever cause, and emanating spontaneously from the central luminary; …
One of the kicky things about sitting here in the middle of my forties is that sometimes I find myself bogged down in what I like to call the “kids, get off my lawn” syndrome.
Dante [Alighieri] now mounts up from the Heaven of the fixed stars to the Primum Mobile, or Crystalline Heaven.
While callout culture raises issues of shaming and risk, it has also raised consciousness around the implications of public speech on Twitter.
But the general characteristics of the genre set limits on the individual genre film, which renders it simpler for the audience to follow.
The equinoctial was supposed to revolve, because it was the "girdle" of the primum mobile, and turned with it.
A similar response is elicited by the genre film, with Langford suggesting that the “combination of sameness and variety is the linchpin of the generic contract”.
Far more extravagant (insanior) yet is the idea of the whirling of the supposititious primum mobile, which is still higher, deeper, more immeasurable; and yet this incomprehensible primum mobile would have to be of matter, of enormous altitude, and far surpassing all the creation below in mass, for else it could not make the whole universe down to the earth revolve from east to west, and we should have to accept a universal force, an unending despotism, in the governance of the stars, and a hateful tyranny.
While Dixon's views on the audience may not be to everybody's liking, it is hard not to agree with his assessment of genre film; science fiction film was most definitely entering a period of predictability.
Nevertheless, I offer a tentative description of the representation of “race” and “blacks” in genre film.
Have we got among our primum mobiles the force of such elastic vapours as be generated for the purpose out of nonelastic substances, and are not incondensible? A good magazine of vitr[iolic] acid and powder'd marble would not only save the expence of air in feeding fire, but generate heat.
The obverse is also true: homosexuality is regulated by gender baiting. Gender bending by men is not only derogated by heterosexuals; LGBs also denigrate gender violations by men, often in the name of presenting an acceptable face to the heterosexual world.
[M]otion is transferred and modified; by none of them produced:—in all of them motion finds a channel; in none of them … a source. … [W]hat are the several sources of motion, and what are the corresponding prime movers, or primum mobiles?
Otherwise one remains trapped in a false ideology that would confuse gender and politics, or in simplistic gender baiting that is more often than not mere name calling.
Opposition to Indian policy here works through a form of gender baiting that appeals not only to white stereotypes of native masculinity but to dominant notions of dimorphic gender identity and its inherent fulfillment in the heterocoupling of marriage.
The Universal Goddess, the World Mother, is among the oldest, "longest-winded," of the great supporting divinities known to the myths of the world. … For just because she is the Great Mother, so was she there before anything else. She is the primum mobile, the first beginning, the material matrix out of which all came forth.
I hereby swear to become the manager of either the football, basket ball, track, cross-country, baseball, soccer or tennis teams before my graduation. So help me, and keep me at it.
The great wheels, the primum mobiles, that have gone so violently and brought us into this confusion, I move that you will proceed against them, and that the king's gracious intentions may have farther effect, and those only excepted.
Paolo sat crosslegged on his bench, stitching away for dear life.
I remember the heat, the deluge of rain-squalls that kept us baling for dear life (but filled our water cask), and I remember sixteen hours on end with a mouth dry as a cinder and a steering oar over the stern to keep my first command head on to a breaking sea.
Some of the oil-shops colour this [essence of anchovy] with bole armeniac, rose pink, Venice-red, &c.; but all these additions deteriorate the flavour of the anchovy, and the palate and stomach suffer for the gratification of the eye, which, in culinary concerns, will never be indulged by the sagacious gourmand, at the expense of these two primum mobiles of his pursuits.
Each morning you get in the roller coaster car, strap yourself in, and hold on for dear life hoping you won't throw up or pass out.
In the consideration of the faculties and impulses—of the prima mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who preceded them. … We could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;— …
When I wrapped him inside my blanket, he looked like a human burrito.
If I didnʼt run … maybe they will make me suffer this jungle justice thing, burn me with fire because they think I am a thief.
But when we come to look upon them [strata of the earth], not, indeed, as the prima mobilia, but at least as the instruments, the levers and wedges with which the real primum mobile, the central heat, does its rough work on the crust of our globe, they lose their claim to this ideal permanence, and come to be considered as, in fact, newer than the rocks they penetrate and displace.
The TR4/4A had a round black plastic gear knob with the gate pattern cut in white, whereas standard fit for the TR5/250 was a somewhat pear-shaped item.
The standard metaphor for the role of the grand jury in early modern law was the primum mobile, the wheel that allowed all other wheels to begin their turning.
Polished aluminium detailing added extra interest, and included a custom-made illuminated gear knob; a bit over the top, perhaps, but fun to do!
It does take some experience with balance and acceleration to keep a snowmobile on keel in the deep woods.
The primum mobile and main engine of the Information Society in Europe, NDS [new digital services] have been the focus of urgent attention among European Institutions and Member States who are suddenly confronted with the arduous task of transitioning regulations conceived in a very different analogue environment.
As the boys went through drills, Sullivan called orders, criticism and encouragement through an electronic megaphone. “Keep your boat on keel. You’re dropping down on port with every catch,” he observed to the varsity eight as it sped upstream rowing at full pressure.
Perry would have it that [Hubert] Harrison was "a key unifying link between the two great trends of the Black Liberation Movement: the labor- and civil-rights-based work of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the race and nationalist platform associated with Malcolm X." This formulation, however, is a bit of a stretch: it makes Harrison the primum mobile behind, for example, the Montgomery bus boycott that King spearheaded in the fifties, …
[ … ] special teams of medical workers are as much frustrated as dedicated. For they know what should be done for their sick infants, but lack all manner of medical equipment to diagnose, to incubate, to sterilize, to medicate, to nudge small lives back on keel.
We don’t always agree with China, of course. It’s a complex relationship, but it’s one in which, in my judgment, it’s best to be in a position where we can dialogue and discuss things in order to keep relations on keel and keep peace in that part of the world.
The absolute intractability of the Irish question for successive waves of the English liberal consensus remains with us, at least in the diminuendo of Ulster, to this day; but revolving round this primum mobile of colonialism (and recall: Ireland was put to the sword by parliament, not monarch) are all the other crystal spheres of the expansive English cosmos.
[ … ] at the finish the boat is moving faster, and the blade must be taken out more sharply if it is to avoid pulling the boat off keel.
The American poet Ange Mlinko's fifth book is "Distant Mandate" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Her title, borrowing a phrase from the writer László Krasznahorkai, refers to art's primum mobile, its primordial first domino. The drive to create art is a "mandate" so ancient that it should probably by now have expired, and yet when it arrives, still, it is always in a hurry.
I’ve learned the lesson that the worst thing that can happen to a gambler is to let his recent losses or wins knock him off keel emotionally.
Attorney General John D. Ashcroft provided an update to the group on his efforts to develop a legislative package to expand the powers of law enforcement to fight terrorism. He outlined a two-phase strategy, aimed first at “immediate disruption and prevention of terrorism” and followed by longer-term efforts to put terrorists “off keel.”
Isn't there some machine used in car wrecks to extricate people called the jaws of life?
He thought he'd died and gone to heaven!
The power of the “jaws of life” were shown first and set aside.
O vada mi bona omi, the feely omi, the bona riah, the fantabulosa paliasse and leucoddy.
I'll uncross my lallies, runa comb through my riah, rearrange the expression on my eke and troll off for a mince round to vada the bona omis.
Even when drivers have had wrecks through no one's fault but their own, rescue crews still employ the "jaws of life" to get them out of trouble.
Its value is likely to be fully realised when it is transferred to Dijon; there, no doubt, the control of the Mouchard-Frasne section will be possible without any addition to the staff already commanding movements at this nerve centre of the S.N.C.F. South-East Region.
"And then at last I see him, and behold, my chance is gone but by a hair's breadth even before I have it, for he is in the very jaws of death, whence no power of mine can draw him."
God can only be known de profundis.
They are acclamations de profundis, pilgrim odes of those who once again "lift their eyes unto the mountains" (Psalm 120 [121] : 1), trusting that "they who sow in tears shall reap in joy" (Psalm 125 [126] : 5),
And don't you mouth off to me, or I'm gonna slap you right in your penis.
This is the de profundis, one of the great penitential hymns of the Christian Church
Fight sequences fall into one of three categories: “MAMs” (many against many), “OHMs” (one hits many), and “triple O′s” (one on one). Group fights — MAMs and OHMs — are more difficult to choreograph than triple O′s, and TV shows that included well-choreographed MAMs and OHMs received higher marks than those devoid of mass attacks.
The de profundis attracted the ire of protestant polemicists including James Pilkington, Bishop of Durham, not merely because the speaking of the de profundis (usually by some boy) was a traditional feature of Roman Catholic funerals, but more specifically because of its association with Catholic belief in purgatory.
They further engage, that the charity-boys of the priory, shall, every night forever, sing at the said chapel in the honour of the blessed Virgin Mary, the anthem Salve Regina, or Ave Regina, and after it say the psalm De profundis, with the prayer Fidelium, or Inclina, for the souls of the father and mother of the bishop, and for his soul after his decease, and for the souls of all the faithful deceased...
The triple O′s (One On One fights) are all between women (the scenes where the Bride fights Budd and Bill are too short to count as fights as one strike does it in both cases) who in Asian action fashion politely complement^([sic]) each others′ skills.
The great Psalm, the De profundis, speaks to the human condition whether or not one is a believer but the non-believer who reads it must radically reinterpret the One who is addressed.
That which is blackish is not yet black. He who is being enriched is not yet rich. The preparation for a supper is not yet supping.
"It's a' true!" exclaimed Bauldie Queech, in voice of great distress, "it's an ower true tale, as I ken fu' weel, and fu' sadly, though I didna think to hae tauld what I ken o't to ony ane but the minister: but Rory, ye're a fearless and lang-headed chiel at a hard pass, and as ever ye did gude to a puir body at their wits' ends, ye maun e'en help me now."
In the first the supernumeraries consist, on the one hand, of old actors and actresses, some of them of great ability, whom reverse of fortune has brought to this hard pass ; on the other, of ambitious young aspirants of the better class, who are, fortunately for them, undergoing a course of artistic training under Mr. Barrett's able tuition.

Bora Laskin: Bringing Law to Life ‎ , University of Toronto Press , 2005 : “Where others looked at Canadian regionalism and saw a fruitful and admirable diversity of human experience, Laskin saw petty fiefdoms, parish pump politics, and constricted horizons.”
We have had to endure the sneaking regarder version of events, whereby every waver of a green flag is sanctified and those who tried to do something as boring as maintain the integrity and stability of the state and the rule of law are vilified.
These things, to me, are some evidences that England is not yet utterly forsaken of the Lord its God, though the land be full of sin.
Critics dismissed FitzGerald as a “sneaking regarder” and a West Brit — betraying the idealism of 1916 and aspirations of Irish sovereignty.
Below the figure Dutch verses are engraved, which are thus translated: “No better dress than this; I am warm and not yet miserable; come on all those who have anything against me; I do not want any one's help;
Dank meme communities love making fun of fidget spinners, especially because spinners are associated with autistic kids, a favorite target for mockery in “edgy” online spaces like 4chan and Reddit. There, spinners are considered emblematic of everything that’s wrong with society, and they’re used as a metaphor for anything unlikeable.

Although the principle of moral freedom of choice is not impotent to perform legal acts , individual good acts are not yet decisive of the total worth of man, because conversely only a good fundamental disposition imparts true worth to acts.

You took off up Main Street past the church, jumped the gutter, two cars and a four-foot fence, and finally come a gutser in the gully below the cop station.
“Come off it, skipper. There's nobody to miss us if this scow comes a gutser. We're expendable, even more so than the average Rim Runner officer. And that's saying plenty.”
This is an important idea and can best be illustrated by analogy with a Mexican wave. Although the Mexican wave seems to involve the coherent motion of a large number of people, it is clear to those who have been involved, that the “trigger” for an individual to react is entirely spatially and temporally local, i.e. the individual reacts at the appropriate time and space point simply by waiting until his or her neighbours react.
Ole Fritz keeps on tryin' ter feel our possies at night with small patrols, an' they tried ter raid us two nights ago, but came a gutser, 'coz we hopped out an' met 'em, an' they put their 'ands up.
The usual signals for standing are: at the arrival of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; […]; and every time the Colour passes in front of you. The effect can sometimes be like a rather well-dressed Mexican wave.
Well, where you all come a gutser is, over here, we think we're born to rule YOU.
Unless we come a gutser, we won't get near them.
A Mexican wave travels around a stadium very much more rapidly than a person could.
In short, Critical Race Theory is an intellectual movement that is both particular to our postmodern (and conservative) times and part of a tradition of human resistance and liberation.
Now Australian cricket is reeling from its quadruple loss. Joining the hat trick of players exiting the game in 2007 – once-in-a-lifetime legend Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Damien Martyn – was the Mexican wave. Cricket Australia, which instituted the ban, acknowledged that it could be construed as ‘the fun police gone wrong’ but explained that it was the only way to stop people throwing things.
The Critical Race Theory (CRT) movement is a collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship among race, racism and power.
It seems hard to believe that a decade has gone by since the term "critical race theory" was introduced into educational scholarship, and at the same time it is a very appropriate interval at which to take stock of where we are.
Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!
Everyone knows the English have an obsessive habit for collecting things, but there are few more obsessive pastimes than the sport of peak bagging.
We had advanced a hundred yards, perhaps, when our first danger confronted us. Just ahead was a sharp right-angle turn in the tunnel. I could see the river's flotsam hurtling against the rocky wall upon the left as it was driven on by the mighty current, and I feared for the safety of the U-33 in making so sharp a turn under such adverse conditions; but there was nothing for it but to try. I didn't warn my fellows of the danger--it could have but caused them useless apprehension, for if we were to be smashed against the rocky wall, no power on earth could avert the quick end that would come to us. I gave the command full speed ahead and went charging toward the menace. I was forced to approach the dangerous left-hand wall in order to make the turn, and I depended upon the power of the motors to carry us through the surging waters in safety.
When the identification is achieved, peak bagging can be performed; the theory of which is explained here. The practice of mode identification and peak bagging is developed through the use of hare-and-hound exercise.
Maynie had a spice of the Hysterica passio, as seems from his youth hee himselfe termes it the Moother, and saith that hee was much troubled with it in Fraunce, and that it was one of the causes that mooved him to leave his holy order whereinto he was initiated, and to returne into England.
Then he gave it full speed ahead, and shot us into the inlet.
A Bronze Head is a more striking poem, saying its farewell to Maud in a sombre, 'mummy-dead' landscape where the hysterica passio of the mob has become the hysterica passio of inner emptiness, echoed and amplified by the emptiness of the heavens.
Man management is the point d'appui around which all organisations revolve.
Pundits differ in their view of man management. Some say it is an art, which is ingrained into individuals and can only be fine-tuned, never learnt afresh if you do not already have it in you. Others say it is a science, based on the study of human nature and can be mastered by anyone who cares to do so.
In this sense there was an uncomfortable similarity between the lettre de cachet, the “lightning bolt of despotism,” and the people that judged, not like a court of law, but like a force of nature.
In Conte Chelsea have something different, a manager who inherited a messy, enervated squad fresh from the worst title defence in 25 years and threw a lightning bolt through pretty much the same group of players to create a fresh champion team.
About two o'clock the following morning his daughter, who slept with her window open, heard a most fearful yell from that direction, but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl and shout when he was in drink, so no notice was taken.

This morning he said he could not remember exactly where or how the invoice was written. It was used to cover up an under the counter payment from the sale of his land in Lucan.
On the lawn of the White House, with the Iron Lady beside him, Reagan may have pledged that Britain and the USA would 'stand side by side' in defending freedom -- just so long as it was on US terms.
Using the metaphor of metalurgy he had deployed in the epic parliamentary debate at the start of the war, he rose at Prime Minister's Questions on 17 June to remind the House how he had predicted that the Falklands crisis should determine what metal the Iron Lady was made of.
In March 1981, she was put to the test for the first time: Bobby Sands (1954-1981), an Irish republican prisoner, and his comrades began a hunger strike in order to obtain the status of political prisoners, thus showing their desire to receive better treatment. But the Iron Lady remained unmoved and ignored their request.
Rollers are a good way to curl up your hair.
In a castle dungeon in Nuremberg, Germany is a huge, medieval "iron lady" torture device. Shaped like a woman, the iron lady opens to reveal huge spikes, once used for torture and death.

In the delicate parts of work -- in those mysteries known to the erudite as flounces, gussets, frills, and tucks -- in the learned complications of the herringbone system, and the homely art of darning -- we imagine that the iron lady is not proficient.
But, the iron lady's needle is not like the instrument of a flesh and blood seamstress.

When a woman is giving birth, she is trying to pass a small child through her “hoo hoo” (or whatever euphemism you are comfortable with).
Technically she was showing everyone in the hallway her hoo hoo. This is not so mortifying to me as it is to the brand new nursing students, many of them who are male.
"The way I see it, I'm already doing all the work, and I'm doing the spells and incantations," stated Bowolf. "So what do you want, a cookie?" laughed Prolok.
The above speech does address "the state of things existing at the time"; unlike Aristotle's model, however, the Cherokee oration also evokes memories of the past, as well as hope for the future, by reminding the audience that the Native Garden at West Carolina University represents "the continuation of our tradition of cultivating knowledge about the natural world," as well as "the continuation of the circle in which we live and learn."
Even though the concept is new to public scrutiny, pundits recognize that the web celeb archetype is profoundly affecting conventional media.
Invoking the Commission's general waiver authority under Section 1.925 of the Commission's Rules, West Carolina alternatively seeks a waiver of Section 101.10.11(a) of the Commission's Rules, as a means of extending the construction deadline applicable to the licenses until December 1, 2013.

Mommy suddenly said, “She has been saying that today, and I thought she was saying it so she wouldn't have to eat her lunch!” Calie looked at her Mommy. Then she looked at her Paw Paw.

"Classic jiggle television," he explained as he cupped his hands to create a platform for her foot.
Alexander worries about unisex bathrooms and jiggle television.
Hey, don't take it personally. I was only messing around.
Hence the rise of jiggle TV in the late 1970s. As a reaction to the social consciousness that dominated television in the early-to-mid-1970s, jiggle TV emerged as an escapist alternative, with uncomplicated plots and amped-up sex appeal.

The genius of late capitalism is the development of strategies for managing and profiting by its own excess.
Intercalation is an energetically favourable process, and thus relates to the dynamic base-pair breathing properties of DNA itself.
If, then, something like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a pathology, it is a pathology of late capitalism – a consequence of being wired into the entertainment-control circuits of hypermediated consumer culture.
An ideology of technological rationalism in the globalization of late capitalism appears to be a specific example of reification; it has the function of the mystifying concealment of social conflict, contradiction, and war.
Matt Hale, leader of the U.S. white supremacist World Church of the Creator, praised the 1999 antiglobalization protests in Seattle for having “shut down talks of the Jew world order WTO [ … ]
"So how did you do it? Who were the bodies I saw? You didn't kill someone did you?” “No,” Nathan said, almost insulted by her questions, but a smile came over him. “A magician never reveals his secrets, Damarus. Now turn around and enjoy the silence.”
Combs took a sip of his coffee and recoiled, forgetting how hot it was. He ignored the burning of his tongue, though, and asked Williams: "How did you know it was me?" “A magician never reveals his secrets.”
Many contemporary Hawaiians reject both the English name and concept to assert instead that Kanaka Maoli should be identified as a people with a particular relationship to specific places and people.
Kanaka Maoli quickly noticed the power of this technology and called to the chiefs to allow the maoli knowledge to come through alongside the missionaries' words of enlightenment, the guise for colonization.
And the Mennonite boys don't consider her suitable. As you know, oil and water don't mix.
The crooked floors came in handy at tax assessment time. After seeing an orange roll across the slanting floor, the assessor lowered the building's tax value, according to company lore.
The most recommended oils are sesame, coconut or olive oil. It is also advised to oil pull in the morning, prior to drinking or eating anything.
Tax records from 1860 show that on the eve of the Civil War the Alamance Cotton Factory employed sixty white women and eight white men, and the business had a tax value of $57,000.
The Guatemalans offered United Fruit $627,572 (about $2.99 an acre) in compensation, a figure that came from the company's own tax value assessment for the land.
There was a time that the only verdicts a jury could return were proven or not proven. While the verdict of proven has long since been replaced, that of not proven has survived the test of time.
Happy Alien Day, everyone! Did Father Xenomorphmas bring you any pulsating, slimy sacks of goodness? Have you face-hugged someone today?
Having recently seen the original film in a theater on “Alien Day”, it’s amazing how far visual effects have come in the last 38 years.
For those who are into aliens, this is your lucky day – Wednesday 26 April is ‘Alien Day’.
The evidence is undisputed that Scott Peterson and the other boys chipped in (pooled their money) to buy the beer, that they were all together drinking it, that they all "felt no pain".
[H]e tossed back so many stiff highballs that he lost count. Feeling no pain, he proceeded to insult his host, lose control of his bladder, pass out on the floor, and was carried home.
Hill, virtually teetotal and a non-smoker, had by this time availed himself of more than one glass of Schnapps and a chunky cigar, courtesy of Rothmans motorhome manager Karl-Heinz Zimmermann, and was feeling no pain.

I was a fad that year — the way midget golf was once a fad, or flagpole sitting.
"Lane Coutell. He's only been Franny's boy friend for a whole year. ..." "The expression in Franny's 'young man,'" he said, "not her boy friend.' Why are you so out of date, Bessie? ..."
The first miniature golf course was laid out on the summit of Lookout Mountain. It was an 18-hole course complete with doglegs, sand traps and water hazards and was the brainchild of hotelier John Garnet Carter, who patented the name Tom Thumb, the name of a midget golf system.

You can't write a Salon outrage porn piece without the word "problematic" being in the first couple of paragraphs somewhere.
However, all of the above examples reflect the growth of "outrage porn" in contemporary social media, or stories that feed popular anger and indignation, and which sometimes lead to powerful action.
Outrage porn is not new. Similar to those who shame and publicly air their grievances today, the New Testament Pharisees were also known to look down on others with contempt.
98% OF AMERICANS SAY 'OH SHIT' BEFORE GOING IN THE DITCH ON A SLIPPERY ROAD. THE OTHER 2% ARE FROM MINNESOTA AND THEY SAY, ‘HOLD MY BEER AND WATCH THIS.’
It is straightforward to show that the Riemann zeta function has zeros at the negative even integers and these are called the trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
BRITAIN: Brexit is the stupidest, most self-destructive act a country could undertake., USA: Hold my beer.
Unversed in financial projects and calculations and budgets, his approbation of them was bottomed on his confidence in the man. But Hamilton was not only a monarchist, but for a monarchy bottomed on corruption.
The Riemann zeta function is the function 𝜁(s)=∑ₙ₌₁ ᪲n⁻ˢ for s a complex number whose real part is greater than 1. [ … ] The historical moments include Euler's proof that there are infinitely many primes, in which he proves 𝜁(s)=∏ₚₚᵣᵢₘₑ(1-1/(pˢ))⁻¹ as well as Riemann's statement of his hypothesis and several others. Beineke and Hughes then define the moment of the modulus of the Riemann zeta function by I_k(T)=1/T∫₀ ᪲|𝜁(1/2+it)|²ᵏdt and take us through the work of several mathematicians on properties of the second and fourth moments.
Karen Stimson, director of Largesse, a group that fights sizism, weighed in with this comment to The A.P.: "Being fat has always meant being downwardly mobile, especially for women. Society discriminates against people of size." The phrase is bottomed on people of color, an 18th-century term for "nonwhites" enjoying new popularity among those not pigmentally deprived.
When the eigenfunctions are characters, these eigenvalues are respectively polynomials, products of ordinary gamma functions, and products of Riemann zeta functions, with the appropriate complex variables.
The regulatory environment is different in each country, such that it is not possible to put together two equities dealing operations on the same platform.
And now hur prattle of Davie, I think yonder come prancing down the hills from Kingston, a couple of hur t'other cozens, Saint Nicholas' clerks.
The ubiquity of the heat kernels is demonstrated in Sections 9 and 10 by constructing, respectively, the Green functions and the Riemann zeta functions for the Laplacians on compact Lie groups. The Riemann zeta function of the Laplacian on a compact Lie group is the Mellin transform of the regularized trace of the heat kernel, and we express the Riemann zeta function in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian. Issues on the regions of convergence of the series defining the Riemann zeta functions are beyond the scope of this paper and hence omitted.
One of the favorite myths of polar expeditions involves the "Big Eye," the fierce insomnia which is said to persecute the new arrival and which has been lent an almost legendary aura.

Speaking in general terms, my hypothesis is that the pilot wave of my consciousness directs my consciousness through configuration space in the sense of actualizing these possibilities; e.g. a possible hue becomes an actual content of my visual awareness by virtue of being actualized by a mental wave-form, in particular, an intentional act. More exactly, as we shall see below, it is the more complex wave-form produced by the entaglement of my brain's pilot wave with the pilot wave of my consciousness that simultaneously actualizes the sensory quale and a set of nerve cell firings.

The general theory of manifolds of class 2 is a sub-class of differential geometries, which contain the theory of affine connections, curvature and osculating sub-spaces.
Note that projective differential geometry is a basis for Euclidean and non-Euclidean differential geometries since metric properties of submanifolds of Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces should only be added to their projective properties.

the thin edge of the wedge was further widened by the fact that a socialist party … broke precedent ….
Each model also has a rubber cap over the butt end of the bundle, so if you want a totally "click-free" sound for certain sections of a song, you can flip the Thai stick over and use the back end.

For example, the computer desktop is meant to suggest a physical desktop, and files that contain folders are meant to remind users of plain old filing systems. This may seem like we're telling you that water is wet, but the pre-GUI days involved a lot of command line typing.

As we Christians serve our Lord and Master in this world, we are living and working behind enemy lines.
There are, however, other practitioners of magic in the cycle that have no concern for God or for the good; the genealogy of this enemy knowledge is clear, and serves as a memorable cautionary tale.

LeGuin published a short story in Playboy and was asked to use just initials--Mid 60s I think. Andre Norton is a gender vague name. It took me years to find out that she was a she.

White Striping (WS) is a condition characterized by the occurrence of white striations parallel to muscle fibers on breast, thigh, and tender muscles of broilers, while Woody Breast (WB) imparts tougher consistency to raw breast fillets.
The MORS and BMORS methods have evolved at a time when the poultry industry is faced with complex meat texture due to woody breast myopathies.
Their favorite activity was roof riding, climbing the house's many steep gables.
The pituitary is often called the master gland because it controls so much.
People like soup. It's what a psychologist would call a comfort food. Easy to eat, easy to digest, hearty soups are quick energy builders.
Studies indicate that most adults, when under severe emotional stress, turn to what could be called "comfort food"—food associated with the security of childhood, like mother's poached egg or famous chicken soup.
'Well blow me over, if it isn't Barley Bloody Blair,' a familiar voice declared from the centre of a multi-lingual display of illustrated Bibles.
Well, blow me over. If it isn't Mr. Randilin himself. What a pleasant surprise!
After the relationship ended, she overindulged on comfort food every night.
Puss 'unting is werry well for cripples, and those that keep donkeys (renewed cheers from the blues, with angry looks from the green-coated gentry)—Blow me tight, but I never sees a chap a trudging along the turnpike, with a thick stick in his 'and, and a pipe in his mouth, but I says to myself, there goes a man well-mounted for 'arriers!
In his recently published "The Thin Book by a Formerly Fat Psychiatrist," Dr. [Theodore Isaac] Rubin applauds "comfort foods" for dieters. He states that it is important for dieters to have a comforting food on hand that can be quickly prepared – "fat people are most receptive to comfort." At the top of his list of comfort foods is tea. He recommends it to dieters because it's calorie-free, can be drunk hot or cold and gives a little lift …

"I'll never speak to you again as long as I live," said Joe, rising. "There now!" And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself. "Who cares!" said Tom. "Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't crybabies. We'll stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per'aps."
We give here two proofs of the Jacobi identity for the generalized Poisson bracket defined in Eq. (13.69a).
"But it's ever so much longer, and we're so late," grumbled Duncan. "Who cares?" cried Elsie, stolidly. "I'm a girl and I'm not going to climb up the hill in this heat." Duncan stared again. He had never heard Elsie complain of the hill before. Usually they scampered up it, and rolled down the steepest side—not, truly, when there was milk to carry, but at other times. And now Elsie was walking along in a languid, mincing fashion, as if she had no more fun in her than Robbie himself, and had never scampered bare-foot over the moor six days out of every week, no matter what the weather might be. "There's Robbie at the garden gate beckoning us. I expect mother's very angry," cried Duncan, despairingly. "Who cares? let him beckon," Elsie replied, with the most provoking indifference. "Run on by yourself if you're afraid."
It is sufficient to test the Jacobi identity against three linear functions [354] (this reference also provides a code for evaluating Jacobi identities).
An evening hang at Brock's town house, in the company of the haut monde of conservative Washington, would become one of Georgetown's most coveted invites.
"No, but it's not nice all the same to live in a place where lots of people were murdered." "Tchah! who cares! I don't. It's a capital old place, and you never dig anywhere without finding something." "Yes," said Tom solemnly, "something that isn't always nice."
When ingested by a foraging beetle grub [the spores] multiply prodigiously in its blood, causing it to turn an abnormally white color, hence the popular name, “milky disease.”
"Well," said Peter Piper, "we have been called Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg and Gustibus and Peter Piper instead of our grand names, and now we live in a place called Racketty-Packetty House. Who cares! Let's join hands and have a dance."
The volume brings together a global team of authors who are pioneers of innovative research in the digital humanities.
“There is a lot of interest in digital humanities, but there is not a lot of money,” says Ilan Shimshoni, professor of computer vision and machine learning at the University of Haifa in Israel, where he works on archaeological projects that include reassembling artefacts from photos of fragments. “If you want to do an analysis of Facebook you’ll get much more money than if you want to look at ancient Greek artefacts.”
It makes no difference if you fall on the whirl. Who cares? And when you are through dancing you can go out to the faucet and get yourself a drink—provided the water hasn't been turned off.

Freddy Farmer added two one-dollar bills to the hockey tickets and walked away. The two soldiers gaped down at the two tickets and the two dollars. "What's the matter with that guy; is he touched?" one of them mumbled. "And did you hear him, Fuzzy? He didn't even speak English!" "Who cares?" Fuzzy asked as he came out of his trance. "Two four-buck-forty hockey tickets, and two bucks in cash! Who cares if the guy is touched? He's okay by me!"

Tar spot is a relatively minor disease in the Americas, but it is very common and often is present on 50% of the leaves in a grove.
Drawing the rhetorical distinction between the "people like yourselves" at the overwhelmingly white rally and "those people" protesting was, needless to say, a provocative framing of the issue.
A particular useful series is termed the binomial series (or binomial theorem) and is frequently used to simplify engineering expressions. In this chapter we consider the arithmetic, geometric and binomial series.

The consecutio temporum is constituted by the connections between clauses and their verb forms. [ … ] The connections that have been determined with respect to the consecutio temporum depend on the assumption that there are larger groups of clauses in the text than combinations of main and subordinate clause only.
So get on up (get on up) / On the floor (get on up) / Get on up, now (get on up) / And dance some more (get on up)
This analysis involves the Latin rules for consecutio temporum and deviations from these rules. The Latin rules concerning consecutio temporum are not strictly followed in non-direct speech and thought representation, as many grammars observe.

Both factors freeze out other entrants, limit the number of insiders to one or two, and reduce many outsiders to irrelevance, if they survive at all. Lest anyone doubt the importance of rapid scaling and network effects, the Frightful Five benefit(ed) from these factors.
The major asset of technology's "Frightful Five" - Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple - lies in their ability to synergize user databases with thrid party commerce (MIT Sloan 2017; Manjoo 2017).

pretty interesting to yak with these taxi uncles...sometimes they can also give you tips on where and when the traffic police ambush with their speed detectors
Developed nations also are moving at high speed toward the information superhighway being spearheaded by telephone technology. Britain, France, Germany, and other European nations are experimenting with high-tech phonery.
I talked with a taxi uncle who has been driving a cab since 1982.
“Taxi Uncle,” said Valli, coming to her senses, “can't you take another route?”
Internet technologies and various software platforms make it much easier to communicate and find information about others' online communication. a For many – especially the younger generation – the “sacred precincts” of private life have extended onto the information superhighway.
Would a taxi uncle know the exact location if I tell him Sungei Buluh R&R?
“Tiles ... tiles ... splashback,” he burbled, trying to make himself heard over the crunching of diazepam tablets. Boris shrugged, not bothering to talk in meaningful sentences or even attempting to conceal the fact that he didn’t really give a toss.

He is experienced and knows the best spots to pick up passengers, as well as the unspoken rules for managing difficult customers, but Mr Dai is not what you’d call a “taxi uncle”.
The Robertson-head screw has a square hole in the head, made in three different sizes, and must be driven with a special Robertson screwdriver.
You chance upon a rather talkative taxi uncle who is very interested in your lifestyle… Understand that the taxi uncle is just showing an interest…
The Robertson screwdriver is among the tools found at hardware stores and building supply outlets across Canada.
Grassroots leaders still play a key role in the Government’s efforts to reach out to the people even with the setting up of the Feedback Unit.
Our grassroots leaders decided to upgrade it into a modern CC to serve residents better.
Robertson screwdrivers have colour-coded handles, to make it easy to determine which size you will require.
When you are in the middle of a godforsaken exercise area, dying of heat and sick of combat rations, the Ninja Van with its supply of cold canned drinks, junk food, and beehoon is like seeing an oasis.
Not sure if your unit/exercise involves you being in the mountains, but if it does, there are these food vans that we called "ninja vans", because they turn up out of nowhere; you don't find them, they find you.
For any Singaporean who has been conscripted for National Service in the Singapore Armed Forces, the phrase ‘ninja van’ should immediately conjure up images of a pop-up food stall on wheels, stealthily appearing out in the field when tired bodies are in need of sustenance.
These days, local online portals have become complaint hotspots that aggregate the ‘word on the street’, from the mouths of Complain kings and queens themselves.
hoganrock: Who's the number 1 Complain King/Queen here? Are you a Complain King/Queen? What do you usually complain about?
Are we really complain kings and queens? Some academic from New Zealand said that we are a nation of moaners in Straits Times. Sure, we complain about lots of stuff, but everyone does it, not just Singaporeans. I don't think it's fair. Besides what else can we do...its not easy living here...the prices are sky-rocketing, everything is expensive , from owning a box of space in the air to the cars on the streets, and the govt is not helping. And I don't think we moan, we are just giving feedback. Some people think we're being petty cos we have a good life. So should we just keep our dissatisfaction to ourselves? What's wrong with complaining any.
The Torah notes that a teacher of the law must be as hard as iron.
What's good here? I'm way too indecisive to choose from a menu.
“If you tried to tell me what to do, we'd only end up engaged in a fierce battle of wills.” She felt him smirk against her neck. “Mine is hard as iron.” His will. He meant his will was hard as iron.
A simple rap on the forehead with a fist hard as iron and their Fishy-Fish blacksmith would down for the count.

Melinda, diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia, remembered her uncle and aunt calling her “Ah Pui”- meaning “stupid, fat girl”.
She treated the cries of “Ah pui ah!” and “Fatty bombom!” as cosmic background radiation, and learned to drift quietly into sharp imaginings when her classmates babbled in the impassably alien tones of Mandarin as though she was not there.
… Once you're in the Fleet Marine Force and they find out you lied on your contract, they'll put you in the brig. Do you want to go to the brig someday, Swofford?” “Sir, the recruit will admit something, sir.” “Don't lie to me, you worthless cum receptacle.”
She continued to think about how dirty and degrading the situation would look to an outside observer. Male IT worker uses the office female as his cum receptacle. The more she thought about it, the stronger the throbbing grew. The yearning tingle between her legs was getting scratched by the thoughts running through her head.
… Last night, I jacked off into cum receptacle. And I asked him, 'A cum receptacle? What do you call that?' And he said 'Well, I just call her Amara.'” “And all these sick jokes that he makes...like...” “Amara kneeled down to worship just the other day. Did it help? Well, let's just say, I cried 'Jesus!', she spoke in tongue and God said don't talk with your mouth full.”

A regional security framework with a relatively broad mandate could also establish badly needed "rules of the road" for regional states in a post-Saddam environment, which would be highly valued by the Saudis.

Been Darkmans then booz Mort and Ken, / The been Coves bing awast / On Chats to trine by Rum-Coves dine, / For his long lib at last.
That clinical instructor will begin the course by giving you an “orientation day.” Pay attention! You need to know the rules of the road for each instructor and each clinical facility.
As it's evolved, the for-profit organizational form rewards short-term thinking and a profits-first, social-and-environmental-damage-be-damned attitude. While this is especially true at the global corporate level, the rules of the road for small businesses aren't much better.
The villain of a pedlar saw his discourse was attentively heard, and flattered himself with the hopes of a supper and night's lodging; he was not deceived, for the parson was so well pleased with his conversation, that he insisted on his staying and partaking of batchelor's fare, bread and cheese, and mild ale; the latter he supplied his guest with so immoderately that he was obliged to convey him to his apartment.
I am quite alone, but can give you batchelor's fare.

“The dude's got a rainbow Mohawk with frosted tips,” my brother said calmly.
Males are generally rich warm or reddish-brown with darker streaking on mantle and back, bright pink rump and underparts, and faint (not prominent) wingbar; long Supercilium to sides of nape is pale pink with pale silvery or frosted tips, with cheeks and ear-coverts similar.
The frosted tips were used for dissection of subcutaneous vascular tissue, as they coagulate blood vessels better than the clear tips.
At fifteen, he was already six feet tall and skinny as a rail.
The frosted tips are for coagulation while the clear tips are for cutting.
The mountains of Jungali were spread below her, their frosted tips transformed into an expanse of snow-covered fields.

“Yes! Hantu! Ghots! Mangroves and snakes! Mong! Stupid! Diu lei loh mo! F ... your mother! That is why it has been chosen; and the name Hantu helps keep people away. Probably like you they fear the devil,” said Ah Cheong, hurling more expletives at his underling before returning back to the house.
There is hardly any justification for a fare hike just to pay for and retain the bus captains, which was what SBS's Mrs Cheng had used as a justification.
The bus captain informed her that the journey cost $1.60.
In shotgun sequencing of genomic DNA, fragments of a genome are sequenced and computationally reassembled to determine the genome of an organism
Go-Ahead Singapore, the country’s fourth public bus operator, has raised the basic starting pay of its local bus captains by about 4.6 per cent, in a move that comes on the back of recent pay hikes announced by two of its rivals.
No immediate use of Theorem 4 can be made computationally since, with the exception of a few special cases (e.g. rectangular S and separable f) it is very hard to construct concave envelopes and convex hulls.
Explicit expressions defining the facets of the convex and concave envelopes for trilinear monomials, with positive or negative bounded domains for each variable, are derived in this paper.
Now empty, Singapore's chap lau chu in Commonwealth are the highlight of a quirky showcase… A group of recent Nanyang Technological University (NTU) graduates have zoomed in on the chap lau chu, Singapore's first 10-storey flats, built in 1962 by the Housing Board in Commonwealth Drive. … While the chap lau chu were not the tallest flats ever built - the Singapore Improvement Trust, the predecessor of the Housing Board, built the now- demolished 14-storey Forfar House in Queenstown in the 1950s
The cluster of 10-storey blocks of flats also referred to as Chap Lau Chu, while not aesthetically pleasing in the context of today’s public housing designs, served as the face of the HDB’s public housing efforts and were featured on the backs of the new nation’s very first one dollar currency note.
The seven blocks of brown and beige-coloured flats were the country's first 10-storey flats, and were colloquially known as chap lau chu...
Many expected the then editor of the Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, who had traded stock on the basis of his city desk's inside tips, to be fired, but he retained the support of the company, until eventually a bigger, ethical scandal involving faked pictures forced him from office.
When parents are late, childcare workers have to stay back late to take care of the children.
Mr Como was quite displeased and he told me to stay back tomorrow and do it.
'The monitoring system would require Hock to stay back after school until 5 pm everyday to catch up on his school, have one of the discipline teachers to acknowledge the time he returned home.'
A few minutes later I was driving hell for leather to Parel, some six miles out of Bombay, where Colonel Liston was in charge of the government laboratory.
'Because my stupid father thought it would be good for me to stay back and serve NS. he actually insisted that I do it.'
'Sir, you have to get back,' said a uniformed voice, an ambulance officer this time. 'We're asking everybody to stay back.' 'I live here,' he said. 'With my wife and my boy. Have you seen them?'
It was one of the pleasures of the country to be able to ride hell for leather in the early morning... .
Other bystanders had noticed him and like Rizby, had kept their distance, but now they began to creep forward to peer at the body. ‘Stay back!’ Rizby yelled. ‘Back! All of you!’
Of course, we were programmers, so we knew how hard it was, and what really impressed us was that this wasn't just smart programming, it was smart maths. Somebody had gone hell for leather making the absolute best that was possible.
Guys....try not to pa chew cheng too much ok....
Wryly admitting his afc status (average frustrated chump), Mr Strauss logs on as Style, achieves pua stardom and becomes role model and tutor to a new generation of afcs.

I was a zero fighter too before November last year. My dad installed a doorway bar and every time I did lots and lots of assisted pull-ups. A week later, I could pull one and could reach 4 by the end of the year.
Beyond just looking the part, this arm candy is a world-class piece of technology.
Whether you are a zero fighter (you cannot do a single chin-up) or someone who can do enough to meet the IPPT gold standard, you will find a chin-up style suited to your current level of fitness.
I stared in awe as my army mates did 20 pull-ups at one go. I decided that I had to work on my fitness again. The memory of being mocked as a "zero fighter" still haunts me and motivates me to push the limit.

Fujido Iga ware is distinguished by a clear-cut form, sculptured by hand or with spatula, a transparent glass-like glaze, and what ceramic experts call koge ("scorch"), that is, dark spots resulting from the carbon in the kiln.
She got full marks. Not one single error.
The characteristic qualities of Iga ware are scorching (koge), glaze drips, and reddish tints. Especially beautiful is the effect created by cascading drips of natural glaze. Mino Iga imitates true Iga ware in shape and is covered with a thin overglaze.
The Iga wares used by Furuta Oribe (1544–1615) and his peers were largely confined to flower vases and water jars.
I did not expect, Mr. President, to hear such a doctrine as this from the gentleman who, this morning, so eloquently denounced alt attempts at disunion. That gentleman should remember the old Spanish proverb—“Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.”

He was said to be a bad ass, so I guess he had to try to take me down a notch.
So I went to him [Thackeray d. 1863] while he was at breakfast in Onslow Square, on the morning of the banquet, and asked him if the speech was " all right." "As right as rain," he replied.
Everyone in school was 'bad ass, and even if you weren't, you would have to act like you were a bad ass to keep everyone else off balance.
‘I’ve just made the rounds,’ he said, ‘and everything looks as right as rain.’
Sure enough, big, ole, bad ass football player was already there with his shirt off warming up.

The reader now has examined, in some detail, several specific modular arithmetics, namely, ℤ₂,ℤ₅,ℤ₆,ℤ₇,ℤ₈ and ℤ₉.
Hence for prime moduli, modular arithmetic is very similar to regular rational arithmetic with all four operations defined.
Corollary 1. — The convex envelope of a subset A of E is identical with the set of linear combinations ∑ᵢ𝜆ᵢx_i, where (x_i) is any finite family of points in A, the numbers 𝜆ᵢ>0 for all i and ∑ᵢ𝜆ᵢ=1.
The polytopes are, by definition, the convex envelopes of finite sets of points of an affine space.
Tawarmalani and Sahinidis (2001) developed the convex envelope and concave envelope for x/y over a unit hypercube, compared it to the convex relaxation proposed by Zamora and Grosmmann (1998a), (1998b), (1999), proposed a semidefinite relaxation of x/y, and suggested convex envelopes for functions of the form f(x)y² and f(x)/y.
Comparing the use of convex envelopes for bilinear and trilinear forms in building convex approximations for MINLPs motivated the study in [6], and comparisons involving more general functional forms motivate the present article.

They were very happy, these poor little folks, to be invited to a dinner party, given by “that rich kid, Alex.”
Ibn Battuta has inevitably been compared with him and has usually taken second prize as "the Marco Polo of the Muslim world" or "the Marco Polo of the tropics"

It was only a few days after her kidnapping that theories began to develop in radical circles that Patricia Hearst planned her own kidnapping. According to prevailing conjecture, she was a rich kid out for fun, rebelling against the social restrictions of upper-class life.

The narrative mapping of rhetorical strategies between narrator, characters and readers is supplemented by a network of interior duplication with the device of the mise en abyme.
Implicitly, the enunciative mise en abyme reflects an implied author who is attempting to persuade an authorial audience that would identify with the dismayed people.
Hoo, boy, Angie thought with only a vague sense of reality. She was in it now. Deep.
The boy, on the other hand... hoo, boy! He was transformed with powers unknown to most humans.
Herman finds that “the opening poems are as marked by 'linguistic difference' and mise en abymes as the poems addressed to the dark lady.”
To distract undue public scrutiny of the paper general, SAF officers – regular and otherwise -- were instructed to use their military rank before their names.
At the risk of some simplification, I understand the mise en abyme to mean a process of representation within representation which points to the mise en abyme of consciousness that produces it, and is engaged with it in the art experience.
Whenever Singaporeans talk about the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), the focus on our military leader's lack of real combat experience never fail to arise. Moreover, with the mediocrity of our paper generals on display for all to see, there is little wonder why Singaporeans doubt their capabilities.
What’s worse about our system is that all the generals do not have any combat experience. These paper generals have been fast-tracked because of their stellar academic results and nothing else.
These mise en abymes serve to maintain the sacredness of K's self, his otherness in the infinitum, as Lévinas might say.
Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if you're just another one of the PAP internet brigade.
And thus, we can perhaps makes some sense of the narratives he reads as mise en abymes of his own desires.
Some of these comments could be done deliberately by people in the "Internet brigade" with the sole intention of creating trouble for Alex Au.

To optimise land use, park connectors are built along road and drainage reserves which are generally narrow strips of land.

To make sure a seller isn't passing off a lesser durian as a Mao Shan Wang, look for prominent seams radiating from the base of the durian.
Our dozen cabin passengers sorely put to wits' end to pass yesterday without cards in observance of the Sabbath.
There are several different types of durian, with names such as Mao Shan Wang (Cat Mountain King), Hong Xia (Red Prawn), Mon Thong (Golden Pillow), or simple numbers such as D24, D1, D13 and D100.
The coveted Mao Shan Wang, or Cat Mountain King, is a premium breed known for its creamy and sticky texture and bittersweet taste.
Yet years of talks, threats and sanctions have failed to halt the program, and officials are at their wits' end on how to wean Iran off its nuclear habit.

Clearly men are financially more successful than women overall in the fat fantasy field, and clearly fat fantasy is the sales winner in the field of fantasy overall. The question we might ask then is why only Tor and DAW engage in extensive sales and marketing of fat fantasy.

He who prays to the Bell Curve God, will be granted the luck to pass the exams!
Wearing a motorcycle helmet is optional in Pennsylvania, but that's no reason for Ben Roethlisberger to go out and practise his organ donor technique.
It seems desperate undergraduates at a local university are willing to do whatever it takes to help them in their exams - including giving offerings to the “Bell Curve God.”
Upon exploring the Singaporean bell curve on the internet, I came across this comical photo of food offerings of oreos, noodles, and other goodies given to the "Bell Curve God". The paper on the image to the right reads: CURSED is he who enters without a food offering to the Bell Curve God!
Sign up for random events, meet new people, set up a bell curve God altar, skip classes, tell your professor you dislike the country he comes from (just kidding), sleep overnight in the library, party on Wednesdays when you have a Thursday morning class etc.
Even the Bell Curve God can’t grant your wish.
"As students, we are subject to the omnipotent, inscrutable force that is the Bell Curve God. He is the arbitrary being that decides our grades," Dylan Lee Soon Yoong explains.
As with dinner-table discussions, it is best to avoid editing articles about politics or religion unless one wishes to become entrenched in a perpetual edit war.
Do you feel lost? Dejected? Are you worried about your upcoming tests and exams? Do you require the spiritual guidance of Our Lord the Bell Curve God, in His wisdom and beauty and everlasting Grace? Then close your eyes and chant this prayer, and all your troubles will be answered by Our Lord the Bell Curve God and washed away: Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be Thy bell curve. Thy midyears come. Thy will be done in O’s as it is in A’s. Give us this day our daily A. And forgive us our subpasses. As we forgive those who give poor peer grading marks to us. Lead us not into them F9s, but deliver us our A1s, GPA 4.0. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
When a dispute arises, it is common to see a page protected to avoid edit warring.
And what of the nightmare that’s known as the exam period? When students are huddling by their textbooks and praying fervently to the bell curve god?

He was banned from a Thai disco club after a spat with the club's manager.
If you grew up in the early 2000s, your first experience with a Thai Disco probably came at the now defunct Club Nana at Magazine Road in Singapore. Amidst the varicolored lights, cigarette fumes, and wet floors, one could get a gentle introduction to the ubiquitous hang-flower-mechanics that are now a part of Singapore club culture. Since then, Thai Discos have sprouted up all over the island. From dodgy looking bars with frosted Dester Beer decals on the front door, to giant, bastardised symbols of Thai culture the likes of Club Neverland.

Van Vogt's theory of 'the right man is one of the most important contributions to the psychology of violence; unfortunately, it was cast in fictional form, and so never achieved the serious attention it deserved.
At this time of year, sure as eggs is eggs, the TV starts filling with Christmas ads for toys.
It is a questioning of van Vogt's contention that the "right man" is altogether a bad phenomenon. "The Killer might be regarded as a wilful complication of the problem; an attempt to point out that right men are not necessarily and completely wrong" (p. 11).
Georges Rapin's violent response to Dominique's threat of desertion suggests that he is a classic example of the "right man syndrome".

Despite his eloquent praise of the gentlemanly qualities of the highwayman, Ainsworth's robber is more coarse-grained than Bulwer's Paul Clifford. In the best traditions of the ideal knight of the road, he is loath to hurt or kill anyone—but he reserves the right to do so in self-defence.

In the bean curd section, we came across a large plastic bin of tofu that had a strange reddish-brown color. "That's blood tofu," said Chairman Wang, explaining that it was bean curd mixed with pig's blood for extra flavor and texture.
Patients on a soft-food diet can eat pureed liver or blood tofu made from the blood of pigs, cows, chickens, or ducks.
In the US, the code name for a serious nuclear weapons incident is "Broken Arrow". It is US policy neither to confirm nor deny the existence of nuclear weapons at any specific location; this also applies to Broken Arrow incidents.
Now that we have both the black pill and white pill results before us, we are in a position to make a few general observations.
The FAC urgently sends over his radio a cry for help: "Broken Arrow! Broken Arrow! His message unleashes all available close air support in South Vietnam on a priority basis.
Howard [1984] bases his analysis on a "black pill” and a "white pill."
While most people find the formulation of the white pill problem to be perfectly acceptable, many find the black pill problem to be very objectionable.
Before Caras could respond, the General threw down the mike, turned to his second and said, "Get them all the air support we have, everything. This is Broken Arrow"
Broken Arrow refers to the U.S. military's code word used during the Vietnam War. This call was used only in the direst of tactical situations, when a ground unit was overrun by enemy forces. When "Broken Arrow" was heard on the radio nets, all available aircraft were diverted to provide close air support for the endangered command.
He can cull choice young animals for the pot and create triumphs of cruel gastronomy, like the baby beef of the gauchos or the Wyoming cattleman's sonofabitch stew based on the organ meats and brains of an unweaned calf.
I'm not in it for a season; I'm in it for the long haul.
All Pulse elements, this is Home Plate. Broken Arrow. I repeat, Broken Arrow. Forward command of close air-support operations is Rebel Four One.
In this and the next chapter I return to the fundamental theorems of welfare economics. In this chapter I argue that the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics—asserting the efficiency of competitive economics—is fundamentally flawed.
Tibbles the cat rubbed up against my leg, asking for a piece of my cheese.
There are two fundamental theorems of calculus. Both relate differentiation to integration. In most calculus courses, the Second Fundamental Theorem is usually proved first and then used to prove the First Fundamental Theorem. Unfortunately, this results in a First Fundamental Theorem that is weaker than it could be.
Deep learning was given a particularly audacious display at a conference last month in Tianjin, China, when Richard F. Rashid, Microsoft’s top scientist, gave a lecture in a cavernous auditorium while a computer program recognized his words and simultaneously displayed them in English on a large screen above his head.
The typical political sharp practice of manipulating history to suit the current agenda.

Nearly half of those in status zero have no qualifications and only 37 percent have GCSEs or above.
In Britain it has been estimated that, at any point, approximately one in seven 16- and 17-year-olds are status zero, meaning that they are not in education, training or employment (Istance etal., 1994), and since 1988 most status zero young people aged under 18 have not been eligible for social security payments.
Analysis shows no time at which status zero occurred. Status zero is when no emergency services vehicles are available.
Gold Cross will enter into mutual aid agreements with other local 24-hour licensed service providers who can be called in the event Gold Cross gets to system status zero – already doing this.
The bunny ate the rabbit food.
"She was unconscious, we thought we were going to be dealing with a status zero (death), but she managed to regain consciousness," Ms Shadbolt said.
They said I was status one. There's only one below that — status zero, which is dead.
Are you on a diet? Why are you eating that rabbit food?
So few young people found employment they are almost immaterial to the analysis. For the purposes of this paper, one critical finding was that two-fifths of these young people experienced Status Zer0 for six months or more (an arbitrary cut-off point, but a pertinent one nonetheless, since it represents a quarter of the full course of a youth training programme).
Unemployed young people and those not engaged in education or training -- pejoratively referred to first as Status Zer0 and then NEETs (Furlong, 2006) -- became a special focus of concern, with a consequent drive to encourage, if not to coerce, participation.
A cursory comparison of status zer0 young people from two neighbouring, but contrasting localities illuminates not only important similarities amongst status zer0 young people but also some striking differences: in backgrounds, support networks, attitudes and anticipated futures.
What was particularly disturbing in the data is that, of those in status zer0, 'long-term' members far outnumbered the 'short-termers' who had spent less than six months out of work and learning - only 6 out of the 402 sample (Istance et al., 1994, p. 53).
They'd just got a delivery and it smelt lovely, and some oven bottoms as well. I'll make us a nice sarnie.
Michael and his brother Richard ate battered savs on sticks as they walked across the carpark towards the beach.
You forgot to mention their commentary on the men's gymnastics: : "Flatbag... into a hello boys... and an I'm over here. Straight into a : battered sav! Oh yes Roy, very battered." The women's wasn't too bad either. "ANOTHER Dutch wink!".
But Andy and Ben, they are lovers, not fighters … and they are going the battered sav.

Those funny pipes were used for opium-smoking — just a puff for each shining black pill, and then oblivion to all earthly cares — dreams and dreams of beautiful worlds.
I knew a girl-a black pill freak, strung out on the black pills, . . .
Desperately injured, sick, or miserable workers used the "black pill," an overdose of opium, to commit suicide.
Once an individual had accessed this page they would be directed to a number of stories that described other candidates, in this case Fillon and Macron, as crooked, and also described French democracy as a broken system (the black pill content).
Yet some of the most high-profile men in the alt-right are dismayed by the manosphere's hostility, worried that it has become rife with young men who have been black pilled, turned into angry nihilists who might become homicidal or suicidal incels.
Her crime was less dramatic: she was found guilty of keeping a disorderly house by the Westminster magistrate Sir John Gonson […].
If it is their time can they die with dignity and should they have the choice to know about and utilize the ancient method of self-euthanasia used by the lamas throughout time? What is this ancient method and can it be misused? How do we know if what we are facing is our check-out time or just a challenge?
Several water smudges and an obvious attempt to wipe them away dotted across the paper. Also, I never (sorry about that, I got a little weepy— fuck it!) planned to carry this affliction to term. My check-out time is another thing that's going to be my call. Dying an inch at a time is not my style.

Often the pain may not appear until you are a mile or two into your workout, and may feel worse as you continue or when you run or walk downhill or downstairs. Many times the pain will subside if you stop running momentarily and walk with very short steps. That's because walking minimizes the rubbing of the band over the joint. Most often IT band problems occur at the knee, but you may also feel discomfort closer to your hip, and/or all along the IT band due to its tightness.
Both conditions are a type of repetitive strain injury from friction at either end of an important structure known as the iliotibial band. Because the common denominator in what causes injury is friction, both conditions are collectively referred to as iliotibial band friction syndrome. Runner's knee is the more common form of this syndrome.

This observation is in line with common human intuition that too strong or too weak opponents are not as valuable as the ones playing on approximately the same level. The weakest feature of KnightCap was playing in the opening phase. One possible remedy to this problem is the idea of “permanent brain” introduced in Crafty - the strongest publicly available freeware Chess program and a direct descendant of a former Computer Chess Champion - Cray Blitz.

They were fighting at close quarters.
The hounds gave tongue as they scented the fox nearby.
He never goes by my Kennel but the Dogs give tongue;

About two o’clock in the morning the moon came out; from somewhere in the distance a coyote gave tongue, and The Worst Bad Man shivered a little.
I was also advised to put on a belt and carry a short cudgel or bludgeon in it, for, as Jack truly remarked, the sling would be of little use if we should chance to come to close quarters with any wild animal.
As the boat drew near the guillemots gave tongue. The sound came against the wind fierce and complaining, antagonistic like the voice of loneliness crying out against them and telling them to be gone—be gone—be gone!

With a sword and shield he could have let his enemies come to very close quarters with perfect impunity to himself and then have run them through with infinite ease.
The Momebys had lost their infant child [ … ] ; they were looking for it in wild, undisciplined fashion, giving tongue the whole time, which accounted for the outcry which swept through house and garden whenever they returned to try the home coverts anew.
Here were the practice rooms where right round the clock one heard pianos playing scales and snatches of classical music, heard sopranos giving tongue, heard the gruff commentary of tubas practising.
He was able to watch some of the younger players he introduced into the squad at close quarters and may be able to see them in England action once more against the Danes.
Likewise, March 14 in North America has been π Day, since in the USA the month is written before the day ('314'). In schools throughout North America, it has become a reason for mathematical projects, especially focussing on π.

In the salon of a Lafitte or a Mrs. Leo Hunter there may be mixtures of the sort — not in that society, either of London or Paris, which there is any pretence for comparing to the upper circles of Vienna.
I will not say a word against a Mrs. Leo Hunter who lived in H Street, and who every Sunday evening filled her drawing-rooms with every notable person she could lay her hands on. Her house was on these occasions a museum of notorieties. Distinction of any sort was an introduction to her hospitalities.

The cryo process relies on partial oxidation of the structure walls, combined with a reduced chemical reactivity due to lower temperatures.
In the cryo process, after the sedative was administered, the sleeper's blood was removed from the body and stored in tanks attached to the pod.
If the children are at home, the front yard, creeping unsodded from beneath the porch, is naked and clean. If the children are grown ..., verbena, old maids [zinnias], phlox, and four-o'clocks, crowd each together for space
After cryo processing, the refractive lenticle was freeze dried, which made for easier shipping and lessened the importance of time if the lenticle should be transported elsewhere.

If Cheney calls it enhanced interrogation, he argues, this still doesn’t change the meaning of the word torture, which Cheney and the public know perfectly well. But cognitive linguists like Lakoff (1996) remind us that the public can be manipulated into believing that torture is “merely” an enhanced interrogation technique and thus does not protest.
I told Jos. of my intentions, and he improved the occasion by eating four or five meals, and drinking at least a gallon of beer and a bottle of gin at my expense.
According to these Categorical Imperatives, certain actions are allowed or disallowed as being morally possible or impossible […].
Categorical imperatives do not typically contain an 'if. They tell you what to do unconditionally. They may nevertheless be defended by reasons.
The people adopted the government they had framed, and thus gave it its moral authority.
This seems implausible. If ecstasy is going to be stepped on, you'd dilute it with something cheaper than heroin.
Soon after, in 2007, Wikidot Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware. Since that time it has grown into the world's third‒largest wiki farm, with almost half a million users running 120,000 sites and serving about 40M unique visitors per year.
There was an essay . . . devoted to a consideration of the many questions which must be reopened and reconsidered on their merits if the teaching of the Church of England were to cease to carry moral authority.
But after God has initially brought believers into an understanding of the preciousness of sovereign election, they frequently enter what a friend of mine called the “cage” stage—the time when the newly-convinced “Calvinist” ought to be locked into a cage and not let out until he stabilizes, or the medication kicks in. [ … ] But unfortunately, there are some who never grow out of the cage stage, and this type of personality often thinks he is called to the ministry.
While the Dalai Lama is lauded in much of the world as a figure of moral authority, Beijing reviles the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
I went through my own cage stage in my early twenties. I was introduced to the beautiful truths of God's sovereignty in my salvation, of justification by faith alone, and the priority of sanctification—of growing to be more like Christ in my words and deeds.
"I know. You have to look for cheap things when you're poor. Father and I took meals out a lot. We had beans and fish balls most generally. We used to say how glad we were we liked beans—that is, we said it specially when we were looking at the roast turkey place, you know, that was sixty cents. Does Mr. Pendleton like beans?"
At first Martin Luther King Jr. invoked Booker as a moral authority for King's ethic of love and his posture of passive resistance to white hatred.
Well I never, all these plenums! What a turn-up for the book, eh?
No less a moral authority than Elie Wiesel, the celebrated holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate, urged President Bush to invade Iraq to defend freedom and liberate the Iraqi people.
“Well! That's a turn-up for the book,” Jim said when Richard told him of the latest mystery.
What a turn up for the books. Monty; dead. She couldn't deny that he'd been a pain in the arse sometimes, pompous and pedantic, but then, that was a byproduct of his job and she knew that he'd loved Sharon and their children.
Santa is not only a moral authority, like a strict father, but he is also like a nurturing parent, traditionally, a mother.
It was still reasonably early when I'd been fed and watered so I headed back to the hotel and, low and behold, here was another turn up for the books. About fifty metres ahead of me was another of Jan's cronies.
Thus, when the military breaches the existing political order, it will be forced to claim a moral authority for its actions.
What a turn-up for the books, Portia thinks, what a lark!
'Well now, that's a turn-up, Eddie Godolphin said, settling himself back into the only comfortable chair in the minuscule room. He picked up the plate of scones and stuffed one whole into his mouth. “That's a real turn-up for the books.' Or at least that was what Alex thought he said; it was hard to tell through the crumbs, cream and jam.
Victims of palpable injustice enjoy a moral authority that is likely to provide access to even busy players.
Moto pants are probably the trickiest aspect of my riding getup. I don't like any gear that really shouts “I RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,” but I also want to make sure I'm protected. Dress for the slide, not the ride, right?
In that knowledge I realized that while I lacked any legal authority, I already possessed all the necessary moral authority to confront and interview Watson for his crimes.
“Dress for the slide, not the ride," said Florida State University Police Officer Sheffield. “Doesn't always look cool it's not always I was just going down the street. But if you get hit by a car and your head hits the asphalt or if you just simply fall over and it wipes out from underneath you. That's where a lot of the damage comes from. A lot of the injury comes from. Its traumatic brain injury."
There were, of course, the hangovers. Mornings we’d wake up late, stumble to Veselka or Café Orlin in the East Village for something greasy and restorative, then trundle home to collapse on the sofa, felled by the cocktail flu, giving us permission to watch basketball doubleheaders and doze all day in each other’s arms, getting up only to be ill.
He despised being away from the rest of the student body and would occasionally act out in defiance by smarting off or by being uncooperative.

A basic model of the phenomenon of Big Science as a style of organization is captured by the five 'M's: money, manpower, machines, media and military.
She looked really fine, a bonafide brick shithouse.
In the 1960s, Big Science was identified as a new phenomenon, associated with changes in the organization of scientific research in the aftermath of World War II.1 As the Big Science mode of research blossomed and expanded in the second half of the twentieth century, it became a widespread mode of scientific research in the natural sciences.
Already in 1961 Weinberg asks the scientific community to consider not only the reasons behind the expansion of science into Big Science, but also the price it was willing to pay for it. He asked three broad questions: "first, Is Big Science ruining science?; second, Is Big Science ruining us financially?; and third, Should we divert a larger part of our effort toward scientific issues which bear more directly on human well-being than do such Big-Science spectaculars as manned space travel and high-energy physics?"
Webster and I are brick shithouses, top to bottom. The wind doesn't even touch the smell of us."
The HGP is the first genuine example of big science in the biological sciences, with an estimated original price tag of $3 billion.
Seventeen and nineteen, they were, built like brick shithouses, one of them already with a baby.
Much big science is concentrated in a single huge machine. But distributed big science in this case consists of missions (also called projects) that make up an extended, multidecadal program of exploration

They speak of the respect among their peers that they hope their hooligan involvements will bring, and of "battle excitement," "the adrenaline racing," and "aggro" (short for agression) almost erotically arousing. Indeed, Jay Allan, a leading member of the Aberdeen Casuals, a Scottish football hooligan “firm” in the 1980s, wrote of fighting at football as even more pleasurable than sex (1989).
All of these factors have probably had their effect, though directly addressing the deeper, social causes of football hooligan behaviour has not been a major focus in the shaping of the current version of the sport in England.
All these skinny modern chicks with their perky threepenny bits do nothing for me.
Since the 1980s Chinese professional football has developed tremendously, but the quantity and intensity of football-related social disorder, especially the visibility of football hooliganism, has also increased.
As is well-known in algebraic number theory, there is a far-reaching analogy between number fields and algebraic function fields in one variable with finite constant field.
All of this fits with what the anonymous blogger G2G had to say in his expanded definition of stochastic terrorism: “you heat up the waters and stir the pot, knowing full well that sooner or later a lone wolf will pop up and do the deed. The fact that it will happen is as predictable as the fact that a heated pot of water will eventually boil. But the exact time and place of each incident will remain as random as the appearance of the first bubbles in the boiling pot."

The field of mathematics that these generalize to is known as algebraic number theory. As a matter of historical fact, our development here parallels the development of algebraic number theory.
Is this the smoothest newsreader ever? Joanna Gosling more than made up for missing her cue on BBC News this morning (October 27) with a suave recovery. Gosling was late to start her report, but styled it out with a smooth "belated good morning".
Elementary arithmetic studies divisibility and factorization of ordinary integers, Algebraic number theory considers the same questions for algebraic numbers, solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients. In this setting, (un)fortunately, the uniqueness of prime factorization no longer holds. Remedying and measuring its failure is the starting point of algebraic number theory.
It is no use gaily arranging for large hauls of coal to converge on a Scunthorpe steelworks if the latter's sidings are already full to overflowing, and many sizeable traders are therefore advised each morning of traffic that is in the railway pipeline for them, to ascertain if they are able to receive it.
Most writers can make the most startling advances in their writing simply by working to eliminate their Department of Redundancy Department.
Behind this hypothetical Great Firewall of China, most users would be allowed to exchange information with foreign sites if they were on the approved list
Many students in graduate school make tongue-in-cheek comments about the redundancy contained in most dissertations: "If the sentence isn't in there three times, it's not important. … this dissertation resulted from a grant from the Department of Redundancy Department." Ellis's work is an excellent example of a paper written with every apparent attempt to avoid redundancy; it is concise, brief, definitely not wordy, and reports data on an important problem.
The "Great Firewall of China" is failing, largely due to the increased volume of Internet traffic in China.
A driver's immersion certificate, my fictitious wallpaper diploma, is not a prerequisite to receive a UAE driver's license. But it should be. Likewise, basic driving coursework is not a requirement.

In fact, the rebel flag is so prolific in the revival some musicians intentionally avoid using it not because of racially charged meanings but to affirm their own uniqueness and individuality as southern rockers.
The targets suggest the attackers are sympathetic to the vast censorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall of China.
Antarctica is the best place in the world to find meteorites, and the search for Antarctic meteorites begins with the search for blue ice.
Clanton and Carolyn made no complaints, but she could tell they would have preferred a Mickey D to her festive efforts. The best thing about the turkey was the skin.
Typically, blue ice areas form where mountains obstruct ice flow and high winds transport a lot of snow.
Tejada quickly sobered them: "How much a cow weigh after Mickey D be through with him?
A chunk of blue ice, apparently from the holding tank of an aircraft toilet, ripped a hole in an elderly couple's roof and destroyed a bed.
Simey had just returned home from taking her 6-month-old son to a doctor when a block of "blue ice" landed in the master bedroom, right on her bed.
[…] the local metropolis, population twelve thousand, a Mickey D, three gas stations, and a Bi-Lo […].
Salami slicing is a way to make progress under conditions of low trust. The tactic works best if begun with issues of low importance to the opponents. Salami slicing may be useful early in a negotiation against opponents facing a deadline.
Damn thing even promised free Mickey D chicken salad coupons for filling out questionnaires.
At that time there were short-term expedients, salami slicing and budgets being cut without regard to the impact on quality.
You know the type: "We'll officially forbid torture but if you—soldier or law enforcement officer or intelligence agent—engage in it illegally with the intent of protecting me and mine and it turns out that you just might have protected us then we'll pardon you. Then we can feel clean and safe and pure and virtuous and still be properly grateful." Despicable moral cowardice; that's what that is. Someone (Michael Kinsley, I think) called all this, "salami slicing." He was right, of course, it often is salami slicing.
Webb and Veikko watched across a meadow of larkspur and Indian paintbrush, and behind them a little creek rushed down the hillside.
No research has investigated whether salami slicing may also occur in publications presenting results from pooled analyses of clinical trials.
The baby spat up her breakfast.
From the author's viewpoint, salami slicing may also be counterproductive. Papers that make incremental advances are less likely to be accepted by reputable journals [303] [314].
Last, but not lease, salami slicing may encourage some practices (such as fabrication of data and unnecessary extrapolation of results) that have ethical implications. Yet it is arguable that salami slicing is justifiable if a major research project is so extensive that it involves several research groups across disciplines.
Don't show the dead bird to him; he'll just spit up.
Usually baby doesn't need to be burped if (1) he consistently takes his usual amount of formula, gradually increasing his capacity as the weeks go by and (2) if he hasn't spit up when put down unburped after most feedings.
The fighting spirit of the German army is supplied by the officer and N. C. O. It has been proved that when a German soldier sees his bayonet his fighting value is finished — he "chucks up the sponge."
A bombing attack along a trench can only be met by a bomb defence. The bayonet is practically neglected by the Bosche, except when our men compel him to use it. He is not much good with it, and if his bomb defence fails him, usually chucks up the sponge.
Yes, DSL is a better, faster and less expensive way to access the Internet. Unfortunately, it's saddled with back-office systems that belong in the Dark Ages and politics that may require regulatory oversight.
For my part, I think the best thing to do is to chuck up the sponge at once; the company is practically bankrupt now, and the longer we waits the worser it will be.
Put yourself back in the dark ages, the time before the Internet took off–say, the 1970s–and ask: What was the environment for creativity then?
Finally got custom moulded earplugs. Hearing protection is a big mood for me from now on.
Montagu was said to have 'invented' the sandwich as a means of keeping his energies up while spending endless nights at the gambling table. I think we can all agree that's a big mood, [ … ]
Although having a large ego is considered undesirable, at times it is proper to take credit where it is due rather than display false modesty.
my professor just got frustrated, said he couldn't speak anymore and left class.... honestly big mood.
At her invitation he outlined for her the succeeding chapters with terse military accuracy ; and what she liked best and best understood was avoidance of that false modesty which condescends, turning technicality into pabulum.
From exposing her heart and soul on title track 'Cuz I Love You' to listing all the types of boys she likes (big mood) on 'Boys,' the album is versatile and just generally good fun.
The call wouldn't get through no matter how many times I tried.
Along with a high-quality dry dog food, I feed 1⁄2 cup (20%) of a high-quality dog roll made from 100% fresh ingredients containing NO by-products, or nasty preservatives. Butch Black Label dog roll uses only fresh ingredients and contains beef that the dry dog food does not have due to importing laws in New Zealand.
He was such a dyed-in-the-wool partisan that I just couldn't get through to him and change his mind.
Changing a dog from a diet of mainly tinned or cooked meat, processed dog roll or dried dog food, to a natural diet of primarily raw meat and raw bones, maybe also with fasting and random feeding, should be carried out over a three to four week period.
Right now though I'm so hungry I could eat the arse out of a low flying duck, so off to put the nose bag on.
He just about pitched a tent when he caught sight of her.
"'Ken oath, I'm so hungry I could eat the crotch out of a low flying duck," announced Jaime.
The engine-driver and fireman did not see her. They were leaning out on the other side, telling the Porter a tale about a dog and a leg of mutton., #*: "If you please," said Roberta--but the engine was blowing off steam and no one heard her., #*: "If you please, Mr. Engineer," she spoke a little louder, but the Engine happened to speak at the same moment, and of course Roberta's soft little voice hadn't a chance.
I was all over the place like a mad woman's custard.
I also have doubts if you really are an Aussie because you came into a bar and never bought a drink Damn me didgeridoo Dave! I'm as dry as a dead dingo's donga! How much can a koala bear!

In many discussions the concepts of big and little science are presented in near mythical terms — terms that cloud the complexity of the issues involved. Little science is usually represented by the lone researcher working in the laboratory on self-chosen problems, generally oblivious to the needs and/or requests of society.
… away the flesh and cause ulcers and buboes (blue balls).
Little science is conducted on a smaller scale, with smaller communities, less agreement on research questions and methods, and less infrastructure.
It invades lymphatics, is carried to the inguinal lymph nodes, where multiple abscesses, buboes, or "blue balls" appear. A brawny edema of the labia, with deeply penetrating destructive ulcers may occur in the late stages.
However, when juxtaposed to other traditions, big science is unlike small science, which by definition is less ensnared in bureaucratic turf protecting, institution building, and financial and intellectual reward incentives.
There is a story, possibly true, that illustrates forcefully the difference between contemporary big science and traditional, small science – science as it used to be before World War II.
He carried the petition door to door, collecting signatures.
The ability of the scientist to be objective and neutral is greatly diminished and the intent of the scientist to "let the dice fall where they may" becomes nearly impossible to achieve.
He sold magazine subscriptions at inflated prices door to door.
If the players are acting foolishly, such as charging into a dangerous situation without a plan or without taking any precautions, let the dice fall where they may. The surviving characters will quickly learn not to be so hasty or foolish in the future.
Our recommendation for a beginning DM is to avoid fudging and to let your players know you're going to let the dice fall where they may. If you do decide to fudge the dice behind the screen, don't announce it to the players and don't make it obvious.
Selling door to door is the best training - and test - for a new salesman.
The most remarkable parallel to this spell is contained in the New Testament story of the Gadarene swine.
The express company could only handle shipments door to door on the West Coast, needing others to reach the rest of the country.
Here Dostoevsky uses the biblical story of the Gadarene swine—a tale of unclean devils that, having been exorcised from a sick or mad man by Christ, enter a herd of swine that then rushes headlong down a steep bank into the sea (Mark 5:2-20)—to generate a series of analogies that suggest that Russia is a sick or mad man possessed by devils and that the swine that the devils enter upon being exorcised are the revolutionaries (Devils, 647–48). In The Master of Petersburg, however, Coetzee applies the story of the Gadarene swine not only to Russia and the phenomenon of revolutionary nihilism but also to the character Dostoevsky himself.
Is the startling variety of dogs, brassicas and the like, which our unnatural selection has generated, a sort of compensation, I wonder?
It was purely a CIA operation, door to door.
Unnatural selection generally acts at cross purposes to the long-term goal of sustainable harvest of wild populations and can reduce the frequency of phenotypes valued by humans. Harvest can affect sexual selection because it tends to remove individuals with particular characteristics, such as large size or elaborate weapons from those of the breeding pool.
There are 16 female cabdrivers in town, most of them Koreans with limited English skills. Which is just as well, says Alla Tinker, because they don't want to understand much of what their male customers say.
For the past three years, his forces of evil and good have waged a pitched battle in a Carnival trilogy that concluded last year in Washington, D.C. There, whorish Madame Hiroshima, wearing a two-story, 3,000 ostrich-plumed mushroom cloud, and 60 jab molassie and tassa drummers led a parade of several hundred North American peace marchers on the 40th anniversary of the Japanese bombing.
Taking [John] Milton's devils, angels and imps as conceived by a 17th century European imagination, he localised these characters with lines drawn from our indigenous mas, such as bats, jab molassie and demons.
Marshall stepped away from the conversation, and it was just as well. It could only have gotten hotter from that point
'What are you doing here, Novik?' 'Well I'm not here to fuck spiders, Karylon. I'm here for you, of course.'
Brilliant mind, thought Geller. Absolutely brilliant. It's probably just as well. Imagine a countenance like that without a mind to offset it.
After all, Nuggsy was not here to fuck spiders — and he never would be.
But they wouldn't find out by standing around. Eva clapped her hands together. “We're not here to fuck spiders, let's do this."
Are crimes more frequent in that country than in the other States ? Are there more executions ? I believe there have been as few as in any part of the Continent, and those which have token place have been generally of emigrant convicts, or fugitive •wheel-barrow men ; he would be bold to assert that in no State on the Continent is there more order, sobriety, and obedience to good government; more industry and frugality; nor is there any trace of the influence of slavery on the character of her citizens.
After a moment of silence, it was Miles who announced in a clear and firm voice, “The cards you have put down there all happen to be black—your ‘red’ is the nine of diamonds, the curse of Scotland, and it's right here,” reaching to lift the sharper's hat, and to remove from atop his head, and exhibit, the card at issue.
"wheel-barrow men" — felons from the county jail who were condemned earlier by a strange law to sweep the streets "publickly and disgracefully weighted down with irons."
And moreover, the aforesaid Centinel, as a false traitor, &c. in order to fulfil those his most horrid and diabolical treasons, and traiterous compassings, imaginations and purposes aforesaid, and to leave nothing undone, which envy, hatred, malice, ambition and a diabolical heart could suggest, did collogue with certain wheel-barrow men, convicts and criminals, now in the new gaol of the city and county of Philadelphia, ...
Sooner or later we have to have rules, and we have to know that they are not going to change, for people to have business plans developed and so that they can go out and raise capital and stick with their business model. But if there is this constant uncertainty that when the Commission changes, or when they have another rule tha they are going to move the goal posts again, nobody is going to want to have anything to do with this field.
The roads were repaired and maintained by "wheel-barrow men," convicts sentenced for lesser crimes and assigned to work projects.

During red flag warnings, firefighting agencies will alter their staffing and equipment resources dramatically to accommodate the increased forecast risk.
The former PBL boss let slip in court this week that he needed an early mark yesterday to attend "a dinner" with the PM.
She's always going on at him about something, but to him it's all water off a duck's back.
This strategy of family grouping and sharing of responsibilities appears to be designed to enable coati mothers to devote more time to searching for food, rather than having to individually protect their young.
Frude's (1990) discussion of the psychological definition of family, further elaborated in Chapter 2, accords well with family nursing, in that it recognises the non-traditional family groupings such as cohabiting couples, blended families, homosexual couples and any variations on traditional family groupings which may be encountered when working with families from cultures other than that of the host country.
The old man [ … ] glibly gulped down the whole narrative.
Indeed, viewing Jewish women by family formation and moving from the more mature family groupings to the youngest family groupings, the data indicate a dramatic decline in employment in clerical and technical capacities and a corresponding increase in those employed in professional capacities.
The intervention can also be interpreted as drawing the youngster into the boundaries of the family grouping and as giving him greater power in that situation because of the attention and company he received.
To a large extent the grouping is built up from partially facial characters, and I am not at all surprised to find Palamtologists offering suggestions, or making re-arrangements of the family grouping. The family Cerioporidae is particularly obnoxious, for there is not the least affinity between the Spiropora of Haime and the Heteroporella of Busk.
Alternatively, once the genus or family grouping is known, you may prefer to look up the distribution maps for that particular group and then list the species known in the area from which your specimen comes.
The individual members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily are referred to using the nomenclative CYP (for the superfamily) plus a number identifying a family grouping of isozymes with a more than 40% homology of amino acid sequences (e.g., CYP2).
The stitches in each family grouping are explained in order of progressive difficulty.
The breakfast buffet opens at nine o'clock (= "The breakfast buffet opens at 9:00 a.m.").
Is family grouping applied in storage with the objective of making processes efficient?
Supper was served at nine o'clock (= "Supper was served at 9:00 p.m.").
Family grouping, as Elsa Ferri pointed out in her study of combined nursery centres (Ferri etal., 1981), similarly carries an element of wishful thinking. What could be less like the average family in the 1990s than up to ten shildren of different ages spending all day in the same room in the charge of one or two young nursery workers?
As Mindel (1995) has noted, use of a “family grouping model” in child care, in which small cross-age groups stay together with the same child care professional during their entire time in child care, benefits children through the grade school years. How many more benefits could be seen in family grouping models staffed by teachers trained on attachment relationship building?
We've got a bogey at nine o'clock.
Some things can go in the water, like my dolphin boots, but other things, like books, are not so good when they get wet.
I cannot but wish to take this opportunity of expressing my sense of gratitude, by giving the name Georgium Sidus [ … ] to a star, which (with respect to us) first began to shine under His auspicious reign.
The Norman had here laid aside some of his northern roughness, and become and apt disciple of the gay science in which Frederick had won a foremost place.
It is the nature of lime to attract oils, and dissolve vegetable bodies: Hence arise the good effects of lime in the improvement of black moorish land. Moot earth seems to consist of dissolved and half-dissolved vegetable substances, and it is said that lime assimilates the one, and dissolves the other.
The exclusion from the courts of the malign influence of all authorities after the Georgium sidus became ascendant, would uncanonize Blackstone.
Ill news spreads apace, nor was it long before the tale reached Ertha von Reuth.
The satellites of the Georgium Sidus, too, appear to move nearly at right angles to the plane of his orbit [ … ]
In this case, Asian dust was transported by a downward moving low pressure and the altitude of Asian dust was below 3km.
"And who is your baby?" he asked Jane. / "Stuart Little," she said. "He's a shih tzu." / "We love shih tzus," Uncle Bob said. "Let me show you all the fun things we have for Stuart."
She then proceeded to wash under her arms and around her neck and face with a face washer.
I found a handbag on the main bed and a second bloodstained face washer on the slow combustion stove in the lounge room.
Drying your entire body with a face washer does not work.
"Now listen, you little rug rat," I said threateningly, "I'm going to wash your hair and that is it. Get it?"
Gary's son is ages with my youngest and they both play mini-rugby.
Mrs Griggs is ages with Marjory.
"... We'll probably be getting a call some time tonight announcing the arrival of their new rug rat."
Known by the Germans as the SA but more commonly called storm troopers or brown shirts by Westerners, the SA were considered Hitler's own private army.

If you'd like to get a jump on the holiday season, many craft stores already have holiday patterns out.
He repeated the question, stressing that the answer had to be a super power. Hamish had come back with 'Russia or America' and Kit hadn't understood. It had caused trouble. Kit had become upset, Loretta angry. Hamish backed down and said, 'Captain America', which satisfied Kit.

They treated the dock workers like two-legged beasts of burden.
Reggie was getting up from his perch on Pervert's Row for a trip to the loo just as the lanky yob seated next to him shouted out, "Oh, look she's having a picnic. Hey, baby, is it all-you- can eat?"
Several blocks north of the police department, Patrick O'Brien sat in the basement of a decaying hotel, in the back of the nightclub at the end of the runway/bar, Pervert's Row.
Extending down from the mons pubis are two longitudinal folds of skin, narrowing to enclose the vulvar cleft, and meeting posteriorly in the perineum, that area of skin between the junction of the labia major and the anus.
It was pretty easy for me to get down with the crew...
Nurse Hall: Is there any reason we shouldn't do a full workup? / Steve Denube: Ignorance is bliss; that's about it. Hangover's worse than usual but that's probably from the drinking and recreational drug use. / Nurse Hall: We'll ignore the ganja and booger sugar markers.

So they spend the rest of the night scrubbing it all off, and in the morning there's nothing left but chalk smears, and they think they've done the right thing. I can get down with that, but the Fist goes postal.
The fact is my father is one of the leading activists against the yellow shirts. You do know about the situation in Bangkok?
I had just missed the red shirt rally in Pattaya months earlier, and somehow I missed flying to Suvarnabhumi Airport the week that the yellow shirts occupied it.
"Look at Clive - just a clerk, and he conquered India! By George! I'll do something in the world yet!" She laughed at my sudden Irish effervescence.
When he got to the ship, I stopped him and started my lecture. "Now, J. J., you know bringing liquor onboard is against regulations. I'm supposed to report you and have you thrown into the brig. But you and I have been through a lot together on the flight deck. So, this is what I'm going to do: I'm going to turn around and I want to hear two splashes. " I wanted to give J.J. a break — after all, he was my buddy and a fellow Yellow Shirt.
A boy should look up to his father.
The Blue Shirts chocked and chained the aircraft, which meant they were responsible for securing aircraft to the deck. This was the first job of a Blue Shirt. After gaining experience shocking and chaining, a person would next move up to become a tractor driver, pulling aircraft around the deck.
The Blue Shirts worked under the Yellow Shirts. Blue Shirts drove tugs, threw chocks, pushed airplanes, and scrubbed decks.
I'm going out tonight to get drunk.
Supporting facilities would include: utilities, electric service, exterior lighting, concrete walkways, an exterior 10,000 square foot paved area for location of reconfigurable Tactical Operations Centers in association with training functions, parking and access roads, head bolt heater outlets for parking, curbs and gutters, storm drainage, landscaping, and antiterrorism/force protection site perimeter fencing.
He held up one hand in a gesture to stay put and walked overto unplug her head bolt heater cord from the strip of electrical outlets that lined the garage wall.
Images of devils, jab molasie, moko jumbies and bats are the figures that inhabit the Caribbean night. These dark fantasies are allowed free reign to bring into being darker, secret fears. The Carnival allows the opportunity for all these aspects of life to be given visual form.
Social collaboration produces such benefits as more effective food acquisition, better protection against predators, better care of young,
She had told me of her love for humankind, her humanitarian efforts, and I had opened myself to her and had shared my culture with her, had brought her callaloo and doubles and oil down and pigeon peas.
Finally, opportunities for social collaboration also nurture motivation. Give children the opportunity to engage in learning through collaboration with a ….
This time for me it was a very long day at the track and close to midnight. They had several oil downs that day and part of my prayer was - Thank you God for this day, sorry I have not talk to you more often.
The car ran an Ed Donovan aluminum-block Hemi and I loved the engine in the rear — no oil downs, fires, or blower parts hitting you in the head.
An emphasis on social collaboration was seen in the arrangement of the physical classroom, including the grouping of desks and use of learning centers.
At time Gentle One permitted me to oil her to keep her skin from drying out to much. Like her mother she tolerated my oil downs,

"Wally World?" He felt like he was playing a new board game and was just getting the hang of the rules. “Around here,” Daisy said, “Wal-Mart is often called Wally World.
Therefore, the value is actually exposed to changes in two different risk factors, i.e., systemic risk and specific risk.
I had a nicely appointed (realtors' jargon for Wally World baroque) mobile home, a sort of plush culvert on wheels, and a new dog.
By investing in individual companies, you're exposing yourself to specific risk, or unique business challenges faced by companies. Specific risk is very different than systematic risk, or risk faced by all stocks.
The Comments certainly contemplate that, with respect to uncompensated, diversifiable risk, fiduciaries act with that objective in mind: “[M]ore than conservatism or a duty of caution,” the duty to diversify is a “warning” that a “central feature” of the prudence of risk-taking “ordinarily is the reduction of uncompensated risk through diversification.”
"Her daughter was reported as saying Kandi ought to be used to Wally World by now.” “Guess so,” Daisy said, her manner thoughtful.
The risk of an investment consists of two components: diversifiable and non-diversifiable risk. Diversifiable risk, sometimes called unsystematic risk, results from uncontrollable or random events that are company-specific, such as labour strikes, lawsuits and regulatory actions.
Over in the corner there was a raised platform, with a roll of background screens behind it, kind of like at the Wally World stores.
On his desk was one of those executive ball clickers, a Newton's cradle, and it was all Ethan could do to keep himself from reaching out and playing with it, but he knew to keep his hands to himself.

Whether you know it as Newton's Cradle or the Executive Ball Clicker, chances are you've seen the educational desk toy that seems to defy explanation.
Meanwhile, billions of pounds of cuts to benefits and tax credits mean that many disabled people and families with children stand to lose huge sums: the poorest fifth of families with children will be on average £3,000 worse off a year as a result of tax and benefit changes since 2010.
In many instances, it is likely that the old man's friend, pneumonia, may be preventable if nutritional status could be normalized.
Dr Pearson visited him regularly, but on the fifth day, when Sam's condition had worsened, his breathing coming with difficulty and a faint bubbling sound, he shook his head and whispered to Jan, 'The old man's friend.'
The price discount ended yesterday and I just missed the boat on a great deal.
The photon number distribution, which can also be derived in a superstatistical approach [23], in general interpolates between Bose-Einstein statistics and Poisson statistics.

"Oh, I shall pull it off. I shall jolly well have to succeed," said Michael light-heartedly; feeling unusually confident.
The basic administrative and judicial framework, however, was that of the Instructions to the Economic Administration (or ekonomicheskii ustav) which suffered from the usual Russian imperial disease: over-bureaucratization and mistrust of local authorities.
Certainly both superpowers suffer from the imperial diseases once so noteworthy among the Romans, the British and the French: arrogance and myopia.
Adrian thought it worth while to try out his new slang... ‘That's beastly talk, Thompson. Jolly well take it back or expect a good scragging.’
And Jon—sweet, dull Jon—almost immediately shares his big secret with his sister-cousins, even though it means shattering the appearance of a united front, which is kind of important, since they are about to attempt to lay siege to King’s Landing.

"So you been knew Crow?" Skye needed to know if she knew anything about her or Savion. "No. I didn't know him. I just knew of him."
The men tie up their dogs, retrieve what’s left of the lion’s kill, and sprinkle it with a generic form of Furadan, a cheap, fast-acting pesticide that’s readily available under the table.
I was paid under the table, so I didn't have to pay taxes on the income but I couldn't complain when I was cheated.
The cross-examination of the plaintiff was just insult to injury, blaming the victim.
I do not challenge the conservatism of this Administration. I do challenge its failure to exhibit a compassionate conservatism that adapts itself to the realities of a society ridden by class and race distinction.
“ [ … ] I don’t know a blessed thing but planting. What does she expect me to do? Hire out as an overseer?” I would, Guy thought clearly, coldly; before I’d accept the slightest favor from anybody. But you haven’t got that, have you, Kil? Reckon you never were anything more than breath and britches.
I believe in a visionary and compassionate conservatism
We’s all God’s creatures and it ain’t in the Bible to sit in the back of no buses or bow down to any man what ain’t nothing but breath and britches.
This circumstance, which is much different from classical particle statistics, reflects the way in which states are counted in Bose-Einstein statistics.
I think we should adopt the slogan of compassionate conservatism.... We can be fiscally conservative without losing our commitment to the needy and we must redirect our policy in that direction.
The path dependence of the interchange is all important since it relates the quantum mechanical concept of particle statistics to the topology of the configuration space.
[ … ] wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque-pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
So he and Miss Vezzis were married with great state and ancientry; and now there are several little D'Cruzes sprawling about the verandahs of the Central Telegraph Office.
The world there was at the same time, by an odd extension or intensification, the local present fact, to my small imagination, of the Second Empire, which was (for my notified consciousness) new and queer and perhaps even wrong, but on the spot so amply radiant and elegant that it took to itself, took under its protection with a splendour of insolence, the state and ancientry of the whole scene, profiting thus, to one's dim historic vision, confusedly though it might be, by the unparalleled luxury and variety of its heritage.
Would you like a pillow, Mr. Mann? Looks as if you're about ready to grab some Z's.
Dean typed a quick reply to Colt with another heart, letting him know they were home safe and they were going to grab some Z's and call if he needed anything.
Have the men grab some z's. I'll take the first watch.
I'll just chat with you while I finish up and then I'll be gone and you can grab some Zs.
At the time, I thought it a good bit of practice for Nicolas to be able to just lie down most anywhere and grab some Zs, as it would serve him well his first year in college.

I have taken responsibility in this matter and made a bargain, in which I doubt not every trustee will concur. As I like to put you all on a wonder I will not be very particular now—but only observe that Divine Providence has already more than answered our expectations.
It was bad enough for white people, but when one of your own color could be so different it put you on a wonder. It was like seeing your sister turn into a ’gator.
Just continually changing like that, catching different trains, I get one or two thousand miles away from home and I get the blues and it put me on a wonder.

And, of course, they can maintain control of half a dozen shit-scared rig pigs.
The cooling palma christi leaves that Janie had bound about her grandma’s head with a white rag had wilted down and become part and parcel of the woman.

In global climate-speak, terms like 'scenario', 'impact', 'vulnerability', 'irreversible', 'mitigation', 'adaptation' and 'adaptive capacity' have become common currency, verbal coins sometimes so worn that they almost lose meaning, even though they carry sinister messages about the future of humanity.
The challenge in all of this, Booth acknowledges, is to bring new customers to Volvo without alienating its core constituency.
During my wedding I wore a blue calico dress, a man's shirt tail as a head rag, and a pair of brogan shoes.
Twain chooses here one of the most powerful and persistent racial markers with which to identify Roxana—her head rag. From this moment on, Roxana is “black”—her race does “show.”

[T]he Statute enjoyns the Clergy-man to be reſident in and upon his Living, that is, his Parſonage or Vicarage-Houſe, if he have any, and not at any other Houſe in the Pariſh; … But the Chaplains of the Chancellor of the Dutchy, Augmentations, Firſt-fruits, Maſter of the Wards, Surveyor General, Treaſurer of the Chamber and Augmentations, and Groom of the Stool, are to be Reſident twice in a year at leaſt, Eight days at each time: …
When he learned that his daughter had eloped, he blew a fuse.
"Ti-to! Ti-to! Ti-to!" has exactly the same rhythm and resonance as "Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!" at the Nazi demonstrations, or "Du-ce! Du-ce! Du-ce!" in Fascist Italy.
As cloacal factotum, the Groom of the Stool presides over the offices of royal excretion; he maintains the royal close-stool and examines its products for signs of health or distemperature; he serves, in this sense, both as a royal confidant and an intermediary between the royal self in its private and public capacities. The Groom's office, in short, involves an "exquisite combination of intimacy, degradation, and privilege" (Paster 1993: 32); …
The exaltation of a monarch was such that few were fit to dine with one. Meanwhile, as many as eight "grooms of the stool" waited on kings when at privy. A king sat alone at the table and in company at the "throne."
All of a sudden a number of the militant homosexuals stood up, raised their hands in a Nazi-style salute and began to chant "Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil!" Everyone in the room was paralyzed. How could they accuse us — those who suffered and died in the Holocaust — of being Nazis?
As the secretariat moved more and more under the aegis of the grooms, as the keeping of the seal itself became entrusted to men such as William Compton and Henry Norris, and as Henry [VIII] signed in the odd moments between eating or attending mass or (one assumes, since these men were grooms of the stool) privy ministrations, it was quite possible that documents passed under his hand of which "he wottith nat what."
Tear gas floated into the Hilton, up the air vents, and into the suite of the vice president, who was preparing his acceptance speech. On the street, chanting: "Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil," and "The Whole World Is Watching." The world was watching, or at least an estimated 90 million Americans […].
Sir Thomas Erskine of Gogar, later earl of Kellie, was captain of the yeoman of the guard from 1603 to 1617, a sensitive office that from 1605 he combined with the groom of the stool, giving him crucial influence over access to the king [James VI and I].
And so, sometimes, did their direct effects. At many skinhead concerts, bands led fans in swastika flag-waving and chants of Sieg Heil!
[T]he privy chamber now comprised just six grooms led by a groom of the stool. And in choosing them, Henry [VII of England] was guided not by rank or status, but by who he thought would 'best content the king'. Chief among them was Hugh Denys, groom of the stool, a Gloucestershire gentleman who had married into the influential family of Ros (or Roos), whose Lancastrian connections were strong. Born around 1440, Denys was one of the oldest members of Henry's entourage and his loyalty had already been well proved.
Then a few voices started to chant "Sieg heil! Sieg heil!", and these were joined by more voices, and gradually the whole assembly rose to its feet.

Three of the spy hops were observed in quick succession on one evening at 22.45ish. On that occasion the male rotated 45° after each spy hop.
Some vacancies have opened up due to retirements.
Would you know what to do if you witnessed the spectacular sight of a whale “breaching”? Could you tell the difference between a “spy hop” and “lobtailing”?
Open up the door!
Humpback eyes are on the sides of their heads. They cannot always see things in front of them. Because of this, humpbacks spy hop when boats are close to them.
Spy hopping is a term to describe a whale raising its head vertically out of the water.
Wilshere then opened up Everton's defence, but Van Persie lifted his finish over the onrushing Howard and also over the bar.
The power of food science lies in its ability to break foods down into their nutrient parts and then reassemble them in specific ways that, in effect, push our evolutionary buttons, fooling the omnivore's inherited food selection system.

The house phone rang -- a sudden shrill squawk of electronic noise.
He was shocked and delighted to see the reaction of his friends and the lady they brought with them. “I am Ash, your new gong scourer at your service, my lord.” He bowed at the company before him.
A gong scourer (also gongfermor or gong farmer) was the man or boy who dug out and removed human faeces from privies and cesspits. Gong is derived from the Old English gang, meaning ‘to go’, and referred to both a privy and its contents.

Bacterial and viral sex, we believe, evolved in response to nucleic acid-threatening radiation and led to the spread of genes as "small genetic entities" in protected packets [Sonea and Panisett, 1983].
Phages are well known for mistakenly incorporating bits of DNA from one host and carrying them to the next, thereby spreading genetic material rapidly between their host bacteria. In the marine environment, this behaviour, which has been referred to as viral sex, seems to be rife, with viruses capturing host genes and passing them around the community
It has come to be known as Chinese water torture, but was actually invented by a sixteenth-century Italian lawyer named Hippolytus de Marsiliis.
My name is General Robinson Risner. I was the highest-ranking prisoner-of-war in the Vietnam War. I spent seven years locked up in solitary confinement. I was tortured beyond belief. I limp because of it. Today I still have a hole in the front of my skull from the Chinese water torture inflicted on me.
The growth of subsidies is a Chinese water torture on individual liberty.
The end wasn't about money, nobody had an affair, and no firearms were involved. I think what I learned from the experience is that if there are things that bother you before you get married and you can't even discuss them, can't even talk about how to change or deal with whatever issues are going on, run. It was an exercise in Chinese water torture for me.
It appears that the Game Space about ten to twelve feet high from the floor, and from side line to side line, and from end zone line to end zone line, is what he needs to peruse most carefully.

Proxy mines are always good because the computer doesn't seem to defend against them.
It turns out that Susan has the dirts with Karl because on their way back from Thailand, Karl smuggled a durian fruit home with them.
Pods are like "little buddies" that help you out. Some buzz around your rivals head obscuring his vision and annoying him, some serve as proxy mines, while others simply bounce off the walls blowing up on the first bot they meet.
Say, Matt, gimme a jint or two of dat green cane—dis ribbon cane is hard.
We’ll grow fine ribbon cane here. The soil is perfect for it. We’ll have all the sugar we want. But we must be patient.
The proxy mines detonate when anyone comes near them (including the one who set the mine) and are absolutely wonderful for laying traps.

One of the most common misconceptions about bisexuality is that it's some kind of stepping-stone on the way to coming out "all the way," as gay and/or lesbian. This pernicious stereotype, sometimes referred to as “bi now, gay later,” is often used to warn straight people away from dating bi folks.

Thus, when he drew up instructions in lawyer language, he expressed the important words by an initial, a medial, or a final consonant, and made scratches for all the words between; his clerks, however, understood him very well.
Wrist drop was formerly encountered among painters, as a result of lead poisoning.
It is scarcely so touching as Daisy Miller, which is out and away the best thing of its kind in recent English; but it is a piece of work so capable and original, so vigorous, and to a certain point so telling, as to be worthy of equal praise and study.

But these modern statutes in Ohio and the Southern States, making towns responsible in a definite sum to the kin of a murdered man, are the exact re-enactment of the early Anglo-Saxon law; except that the blood damages -- the were gild--- were in those days put upon the neighbors or the kin of the enemy.
At one point McGregor had coughed and the skinny drink of water involuntarily slid his chair back from the table.
He has ridden down to the lobby many times with people who work on the same floor as Bill Teale — including the scrawny drink of water from Consolidated Insurance — and they don't recognize him.

Reverend, that gangly drink of water can surely exhort almost as good as you.
It's an outing for the boy, who walks ahead eating a Dixie Cup fudge sundae. Rubio's business district is a block from the beach, with an area of benches and trees that cars are not allowed to enter.

Sometimes a man just needs to jack it to clear his head.
Where I come from, the word ‘reptile’ is a term of endearment, used in much the same way as ‘toe rag’ or ‘moosh’.
Even more important to those promoting paper books was the stark fact that there were not enough book stores to produce an adequate volume of sales to sustain quarter books.
I mean, even with the luxury of a graphic front end, there's only so much low-level control that you can do on what is basically a canoe with training wheels.
You may not be ready to chase down a rabbit and kill it, but you can shuck an oyster, eat it, and get the primal thrill. It's like going native with training wheels.
Also, I introduced him to crayons. Bought the Crayola beginner set—the short, fat, thick ones with training wheels.
While a faint whiff of raffishness remained, science fiction could be justified as a specialized form of children's or Young Adult literature—as literature with training wheels on it, something that would teach the kids to be familiar with Science and Technology and to think progressively about The Future (much in the fashion of the famous “World of the Future” dioramas at the 1939 World's Fair) until they were ready to put aside childish things and turn to “real literature” about “the real world".
Everyone always thinks they're bigger than drugs -- rock stars with training wheels, hard-eyed corner boys or homemakers with a scrip from their physician.
Joe Feinberg, who supplied the decorative ceramic tiles for the Key Biscayne homes of both the President and Bebe Rebozo, thinks Nixon is "guilty as sin."
My boyfriend and I even saw a scooter with training wheels the other day riding through the mountains for a nice summer drive.
A total stranger, cannot as a rule, gate crash a purely private party, though cases do exist when this has been done.
The university did not touch my world directly but you couldn't be a boy in Oxford without supporting the dark blues against the Cambridge light blues, in the boat race [ … ]
One of the women in my group was staying at the same hotel, but she had plans to be with friends that first night and I did not want to “gate crash” her time.
The leaves of the least willow (S. herbacea), soaked in water, are employed in Iceland for tanning leather.
Out on the “strip”, it was party night, so we gate crashed the evening.
In terms of high-altitude survival, the least willow (S. herbacea) occurs at 2170 m in central Norway.
Closely related to least willow (Salix rotundifolia) but differs in having large, slightly hairy capsules, abundant skeletonized leaves, and 3-5 pairs of veins on leaves instead of 2-3 pairs in least willow.
It was 1936 when the twenty-year-old "Ruffles" Johns announced to the press that he was going to attempt the biggest gate crash of his young career.
[H]e would merely have remarked on its elegant hocks and golden horn and suggested that she enter it weight for age at Flemington.
The rest of us were glad to creep between blankets, with a mountain of covers on top, and a hot water can inside. What a tale to tell of balmy Florida!
He stood transfixed before the unaccustomed view of London at night time, a vast panorama which reminded him […] of some wood engravings far off and magical, in a printshop in his childhood.

Joe looked very smart in his demob suit and newly trimmed beard and seemed to be just as excited as his bride-to-be.

Today, Nanaimo's signature cuisine is a little sweeter. That would be the Nanaimo bar, a layered custard, coconut and chocolate confection that originated in 1952 and put the little town on the map.
From the hours you keep … I'd say you were on the bash.
Once they had lost the first flush of youth, started to look like they were on the bash, he saw to it that they were relegated. Like West Ham, his home team, he loved them, but he knew they were not going to win any prizes. Basil's main girls were big earners and, as such, he expected them to look the part. He believed that you got what you paid for, and he saw to it that his girls were paid very well. He walked all the new girls through their first steps personally; he told them how to sit, [ … ]
The only bloody difference between serving drinks to the passengers of British Airways and handing out aperitifs in Mrs Leighton Hunt's Mayfair drawing room was 35,000 feet. It was at a small cocktail party in St John's Wood that I met Amy, a strikingly beautiful young woman who told me that she worked as an escort for an exclusive agency off Park Lane, as indeed did all the other female guests at the party. I'd sort of guessed that they were on the bash, [ … ]
[ … ] cooked lunch, three o'clock smoko, a big dinner and then supper. We always kept a man cook, and you'd never believe how we got them. At the hotel in Wanaka they'd always be getting chefs who were alcoholic; they'd work till they had enough money to go on the bash, then they'd be sacked, so the hotel owner would ring Minaret and send the chef up to us. He'd work as station cook for a while and then, when he wanted a bash again, off he'd go and the hotel would take him back.
We can go back and reflect on things we've done in our past and say, "Boy, I wish we hadn't a gone that way".
In many ways, clean meat is aimed at the least common denominator: meat for the 98 percent of the population that focuses its food choices almost exclusively on price, taste, and convenience.
So now you want to eye fuck me, is that it, Private?
Eyes forward, and don't you eye fuck me while you're on that bus.
At least he didn't look at me offensively; and believe me, if you're a woman who works in a bar, you can tell the difference between an evaluation and an eye fuck.
Goodbye golden hours, As pressure mounts for ITV to set its house in order, Andrew Dickson explains the nature of its restrictive practices and what lies at stake if the unions refuse to make concessions.
“Mornin’, ladies!” The door chimes were busy for a Tuesday. ¶ “Mornin’ back at ya’ – bein’ a bit presumptuous, aren’t you? I don't see any ladies!”
Instead of saying, “Thank you” and launching into the monologue, the host said, “Back at ya.” Does this mean that the host was applauding the audience? What for?

And we went upstairs and we ran a train on her.
“Hey mister, why don't you leave so we can run a train on Andrea?”, “Oh my god,” Andrea said. “Erik, you motherfucker! They should run it on your mom!”
Sometimes, to punish victims, the gang would “run a train” on a victim, which meant that multiple gang members would have sex with the victim in rapid succession.

You need to make a decision whether or not to go.
Instead, this government seems to see a Britain stymied by local vested interests, where our whole economic future is called into question because Mrs Miggins doesn't want a motorway through her back garden, or a nuclear power station built next door.
I wanted to get up to the plate and take the chance of hitting a home run. Even if I didn't hit a home run, I would be working with the man I respected and loved more than any businessman I had ever known.
"You drive me crazy," she said flatly. "Back atcha, my sistah," I said with a laugh, then changed the subject.
“Or how about . . .Are you a parking ticket? Because you've got FINE written all over you.” Back atcha, gorgeous.
And where were you when Josh came up with this brain storm?
In such a brain storm creativity may be stimulated by for instance looking at nature, products of competitors, alternative materials or delivery systems [36], or by focusing on improvement strategies outlined from section 3.2 onwards.
In choosing to begin my presentation with a sequence of diary musings, a brain storm on reasons for studying knowledge as social scientists, and a teasing out of usages of 'knowledge' from two chance newspaper extracts I deliberately intend to start building a field that is not exclusive as to academic disciplines and language.
Being open minded while receiving knowledge to help you brain storm later, is a healthy way to exercise your brain and strengthen your skills.

Well-heeled tourists tuck into French cuisine at Cardin's elegant new Maxim's de Pékin.
Not only have I used one snow machine to generate snow effects in a half-dozen shows, I have also used it with Mylar® and different types of paper to produce successful showers of blue rain and yellow drops of sunlight.
Praying Connie wouldn't spot her, Abby belted down the hillside, bouncing and sliding, engine roaring, and the track was getting closer and closer, and finally she decelerated and eased the snow machine over the lip of the bank and on to the track.
I said, ‘Well, you can say what you like about Joe, I've never known him to give anything away — even when he should have done because I was working with him! Secret squirrel syndrome we used to call it in the army.’
Meetings in the SCIF were usually limited to members of the FBI's “secret squirrel division,” as the agents referred to those who worked counterintelligence matters.
His beard, once black, was now salt and pepper.
Much of Japan's success depends on a culture of discipline and obedience, but they also make extensive use of nudge theory to encourage the behaviour they want to see on their network. … We even have our own government office devoted to nudge theory - the Behavioural Insights Team, run in partnership with the Cabinet Office and which has worked on projects with Transport for London and elsewhere on the railway.
Take anything he tells you with a pinch of salt: he's an inveterate liar and mixes truth with his fiction liberally.
Ivan Ivanovitch, when the weather gets too warm, throws off his pelisse and his remaining upper garments, and sits, in his shirt sleeves, on the balcony to observe what is going on in the courtyard and the street.
It is to Andrew Carnegie that the expression is attributed in America, "There are only two generations between shirt sleeves and shirt sleeves," The remark is certainly not original with the genial Scot, who is playing such a successful " star engagement " before the American people, nevertheless, it is a most satisfactory sentence. If the wealth which springs from the efforts made in shirt sleeves by one generation, is enjoyed in broad-cloth only by the next two, and that, in the fourth remove, shirt sleeves again become ascendant, so much the better for the country.
This loss of trust probably extends to welfare agencies tarnished by paternalism, patriarchalism and association with the Stolen Generation.
Marge Tucker′s 1970 autobiography, If Everybody Cared, was the first by one of the Stolen Generation.
Sleeping rough after a heavy night is not a major priority to most of the local residents on any big city streets. He wasn't causing offence; if anything he was not cooperating with the crew, waking up and telling them to ‘foxtrot oscar’.
While most of the children reacted with sympathy for the Stolen Generation, they also appreciated the significance of the event, with comments such as “I′m glad that they made a sorry day and are saying sorry like good people and not protenting (sic) it never happened.”
On one level, this image of the reunification of three generations of Aboriginal women offers a satisfying resolution to the story, effectively assuaging social anxieties about past race relations, in particular the issue of the Stolen Generations.
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye And sandy-bottom’d Severn have I sent him Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
Ken′s mother is not the only member of the Stolen Generations to see the need to look back before looking forward.
When I tried to put some heart into him, telling him he had four big guns—you know the brass six-pounders you left here last year—and that I would get powder, and that, perhaps, together we could make head against Lakamba, he simply howled at me.
In many places, radio stations invite Stolen Generations people in the neighbourhood to tell their stories. [ … ] Some of the Stolen Generations sought redress through the courts.

I will tell you … what message he [Mahadev Govind Ranade] has left behind for the rising generations of his country, so that the harvest for which he laboured may be reaped and not lost in the fullness of time.
Captain James Cook and party on 31st March, 1773, first discovered the fairy penguins at Duskey Bay, New Zealand.
It's my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of [Michael] Collins and it will be recorded at my expense.
If the entry of nous into the fetus is the moment of the latter's completion, then the appearance of the human race in history may properly be envisaged as the fullness of time.
The Fairy Penguin, for example, teaches us to picture in our mind′s eye a desired outcome, and coaches us to physically and abundantly bring it to fruition.
This game is no fun.
‘Bluey’ is a fairy penguin (more widely known as ‘little penguins’). Bluey is one of the 70000 who make their home on Phillip Island, near Melbourne.

Unlike drifting, set netting is done in a small skiff, not unlike a Boston Whaler, usually between fifteen and twenty feet in length.
In another fifty yards there was a second turn, this time toward the left! but it was more of a gentle curve, and we took it without trouble. After that it was plain sailing, though as far as I could know, there might be most anything ahead of us, and my nerves strained to the snapping-point every instant.
This book develops Grothendieck's scheme theory as a method for studying algebraic geometry. [ … ] In the preface of EGA, Grothendieck even claimed that a knowledge of classical algebraic geometry may hinder the reader from studying scheme theory.
Plain sailing or no, it has got be be done, anyway
The main point of scheme theory is to consider C as a covariant functor R↦C(R) from the category textit B-ALG (also written as textit ALG_(/𝔅)) of 𝔅-algebras into the category textit SETS of sets.
With these ideas of scheme theory, perturbation, and abstraction, it becomes possible to see how metacognition might be interpreted in constructivist terms.
It was not all plain sailing for Chelsea, however. First David Davis saw his strike tipped over before Slawomir Peszko surged clear of Terry and Cahill and rounded Ross Turnbull before shooting into the side netting.
Silhouettes in the darkness before a rat fuck (combat assault) have a kind of fatalistic presence.

At the foot of the cliffs are narrow boulder beaches and a few sea stacks.
Off the shore of still another island they found a stand of sea stacks, weird towers of rock sculpted by sand and wind and engulfed in flocks of gulls and cormorants, and as they banked for another look, Kate saw three bald eagles take wing.
A tall island in the sea, a geologic bone, the sea stack represents rock harder than what once surrounded it and has been eroded away. … The sea stack—which in desert country might be called a chimney, pinnacle, needle, knob, horn, or pillar—rises in the ocean, and is often favored by cormorants, puffins, and gulls for nesting and whitewashing with clamorous possession.

They practised for these by playing games, such as 'keeping house', and kiss, cuddle or torture.
One game was called Kiss, Cuddle or Torture. In this, a group of half a dozen or so boys linked arms and tried to surround and trap one individual. We usually ran squealing for safety into the girls' toilets. Some of the girls who were caught chose the easy route, asking for a kiss or a cuddle, but every time after Urquhart, if I was trapped, I chose torture. I preferred to endure all the boys in the group punching or kicking me than face the shame of asking them to kiss me or cuddle me.
'This is so tense,' Aidan said. 'I haven't had this much fun since I used to play kiss, cuddle or torture in primary school.'
How came the king by a power which the people are afraid to trust, and always obliged to check? Such a power could not be the gift of a wise people, neither can any power, which needs checking, be from God; yet the provision, which the constitution makes, supposes such a power to exist. But the provision is unequal to the task; the means either cannot or will not accomplish the end, and the whole affair is a felo de se; for as the greater weight will always carry up the less, and as all the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to know which power in the constitution has the most weight, for that will govern; and though the others, or a part of them, may clog, or, as the phrase is, check the rapidity of its motion, yet so long as they cannot stop it, their endeavors will be ineffectual; the first moving power will at last have its way, and what it wants in speed is supplied by time.
Finally, I contacted a number of World Englishes and lexicography colleagues who were able to contribute terms and suggest further avenues of investigation.
But on the 24th of April, the wind again blew a perfect storm, and our other ships of the squadron separated, nor did any of them rejoin the commodore.

As Chatter adjusted her scarf and cowboy hat to ward off the increasing winds, Sally Ann saw several gray leaves tumble over the grass and realized there had been no fall foliage in Half Moon. No week or so where the leaves explode with color and paint the hillsides with majestic hues of red, orange, yellow and gold. Just like the town itself, the trees and flowers -- remarkably bright and vivid throughout the season -- had simply paled and appeared to be on their way to an ashen bone-like pallor.

Although the annihilator method is very efficient when applicable, it is limited to equations whose right members R have a constant-coefficient annihilator.
The annihilator method is just one convenient method to select the form of solution to try when applying the method of undetermined coefficients.
Many ways exist to solve the particular solution. These include the method of undetermined coefficients, variation of parameters, annihilator methods, Laplace transform methods, and numerical methods.

The origin of the term strangles arises from the fact that in some cases it is associated with symptoms of choking or strangulation, and it was divided by the old writers into simple and bastard strangles; the first form being that which ran a regular course, and the second consisting in the formation of multiple or successive abscesses. … Irregular or bastard strangles, on the other hand, is a very grave affection, in which the connective tissue of the lymphatics of the submaxillary region, and sometimes the salivary glands, are the seat of acute suppurative inflammation, …

Isolation of infected animals can prevent epidemics of strangles and is recommended for new additions to a herd or group. In some horses, purpura hemorrhagica and even bastard strangles may follow vaccination, though this is relatively rare.
Bastard strangles, in which abscessation develops in many organs, is a serious complication in about 1% of affected animals.

For this reason, less affluent settlers on the community grants took over the care of the large herds of the wealthier settlers, as share herders, or partidarios, on their own community range...
The protection of their herds is entrusted to a stockman the investors are related to, or more generally to salaried or migrant share herders from pastoral ethnic groups who have left their original group.
A clue to the appearance of the slender moa may be provided by deep pits on the tops of some skulls, perhaps an indication that one of the sexes carried a crest.
The same farm, share milked, would normally have a lower level of fixed costs, particularly labour and machinery, and possibly a slightly higher gross income to give a net income of £2,000 a year for the share milker, and rather less for the owner, this depending on interest charges and the amount spent on repairs and maintenance.
This work showed that although share milked lambs had slower growth rates than their counterparts, their carcases did not differ in composition.
"Come into that little brush-shop and sit down, father—they'll let you sit down," said Eppie, always on the watch lest one of her father's strange attacks should come on.
About 30 per cent of the dairy farms are operated on a share milking basis where, for example, the owner is responsible for the farm maintenance and the fertilizer costs, whilst the share milker owns and milks the cows.
Even when he eats and sleeps there is always one on the watch near him who has strength and weapons.
In this case share milking meant keeping the mother from her calf during the night and seeing that the family's requirements were met first in the morning.
“Share milking,” as it is called, was challenged in Indiana, and it took a lengthy battle with the bureaucracy and finally the help of the governor personally before Mark and Debbie were allowed to proceed

The pigeonhole principle is usually stated as follows. (16.43) If more than n pigeons are placed in n holes, at least one hole will contain more than one pigeon. The pigeonhole principle is obvious, and one may wonder what it has to do with computer science or mathematics.
Madison just used it on herself!
Of course our list of pigeonhole principles is not all inclusive. For example, more set theoretic pigeonhole principles are given in [72]. Corollary 3.31 (Ultimate Pigeonhole Principle). The following are equivalent: 1. κ is a regular cardinal. 2. If we put κ pigeons into λ < κ pigeonholes, then some pigeonhole must contain κ pigeons.
Patty said I was placed in isolation as some members of the aboriginal community had placed me in a category known back then as "OFF TAP" meaning I was to be hurt in some way, shape or form. This would later be retracted as Ray had done one of the most stupid things one could do as an aboriginal in prison 'rape one of his own kind'.
Some very poor households actually came out of the recent drought better than when the event began, while some of the wealthier households benefited both from a favourable livestock market and increased opportunities to share herd out animals in the post-drought period.
As we turn to look at various pigeonhole principles and how they are used to prove partition theorems, particularly for pairs, we keep in mind the slogan that is embedded in the Motzkin quote: complete disorder is impossible.
Yet these contractual forms of labor exchange (i.e. hired herding and share herding), described in detail below, exist alongside other forms of inter-household cooperation and interaction including forms of patron-clientelism and, as such, have a diverse array of political effects and implications.
Fleets of planes flew in their daily cargo of white gold, first extracted from coca leaves in Peru or Bolivia and then refined in Colombia.
The milking and day-to-day management on the main farm is carried out by a share milker, who shares both the costs and profits, and the other block has a young manager who has some, but lesser, profit-share arrangements.
Often dairy farms were owned and operated by different individuals and the operator, the share milker, carried enormous burdens in poor economic times.

Puddock had now little to trouble him upon a topic which had once cost him some uneasiness, and Mervyn acquiesced serenely in the existing state of things, and seemed disposed to be sweet upon pretty Lilias Walsingham, if that young lady had allowed it; but her father had dropped hints about his history and belongings which surrounded him in her eyes with a sort of chill and dismal halo.
Odds bud!' lisped little Puddock, 'what a stentorian voice!'
Few sportswear or sports equipment companies could be found pitching their products on television; and even fewer could be found among the Fortune 500.
In the year 1819, Sir Robert Peel brought in a bill, and which finally passed both houses, and received the royal assent on the 2nd July, for continuing the restrictions contained in several acts of parliament, on payments in cash by the bank of England, until the 1st day of May, 1823, and to provide for the gradual resumption of cash payments: … VIII. After the first day of May, 1822, the bank of England, if they shall think fit, may pay or exchange the lawful coin of the realm, for any of their own notes, payable on demand.
Bennett didn't appear on CNBC, or kibitz with Maria Bartiromo, or speak at Fortune 500 conferences, or get himself profiled in the Wall Street Journal.
An American traveler, let us say, lands at Calais with a pocket full of American money; his purse may fairly bulge. But he cannot buy so much as a newspaper or a breakfast roll with it. As far as his ability to purchase the very necessities of life is concerned, he might as well be penniless. His American money is worthless to him on that other shore until he has exchanged it for the coin of the realm.
Early in the second millennium, the spread of the money economy eroded and eventually destroyed feudalism. The moment that a peasant could sell his labor to the highest bidder, the ties that bound servant and master dissolved. … Not only were individuals able to buy their freedom with coin of the realm; at times, entire villages did so, as when the northern French city of Coucy-le-Château bought its charter of liberties from the penniless widow of the lord for 140 livres in 1197.
Abbott was in his late sixties and looked like a retired Fortune 500 executive in a three-piece suit, complete with manicured nails and a Rolex watch.
In financial markets the coin of the realm is returns; in politics it is power. Modern capital markets mediate competing claims for money and power among governments and businesses, savers and borrowers.
If logic and demonstrations of success are not impetus enough, realize that activists are now looking beyond Fortune 500s.
I still avoid the real obvious gut bombs, like Mexican food for example.
Both these substances, gun cotton and gun paper, have been tried successfully in firearms; but as the separation of the fibres of the former facilitates rapid combustion, it will probably be always found most suitable for that purpose; whilst in all those cases where it has been deemed desirable to condense the gun cotton, the gun paper made from paste or pulp will be found an equally advantageous and effective substance.
I shrink a little at the idea of Portia breaking another glass ceiling on her way to what can only be president or CEO of a Fortune 500.
Also found gun paper, a machine gun stock and a bunch of empty ammo boxes.
Jimmy Johnson had the most complete control of the team when he was here. Why do you think that Jones and Johnson split the blanket?..hmmm?...Jones wanted complete control and Johnson didnt want him to have it.
He argued that the military and empire spending are the most feasible place to build a consensus on budget cuts, but, “here is where the Tea Party and War Party split the blanket. . . "
But it can be recalled that Locsin earlier called out DepEd for seemingly being “unaffected” by the actions of a teacher who body-shamed her by describing her “an obese person” in a Physical Education (PE) educational material after the agency issued an apology.
The family leaves over enough food from Sunday dinner for Monday lunch and dinner.
But I shall leave a blazoned trail behind me, Clearly defined, to point the way for you.
Mr. [William Jennings] Bryan recognizes that he must win New York—"or bust." He went there straight from Des Moines and had a three-hour conference with the local leaders.
The rush [the Pike's Peak Gold Rush] took on new momentum. … Each day fresh emigrants left the outfitting places along the Missouri with signs on their wagons, "Pikes Peak or Bust." During the summer of 1859 a continuing flood of gold-seekers poured across the plains and on into the mountains to conquer the Front and Park Ranges.
In the fall of 1951, I was on my way to South Dakota State College in Brookings SD with Dale Pettyjohn in his Model A Ford. We painted the back of the Model A in white letters "SDSC or Bust".
She could not be "tough loved" into improving her behavior and saddling her with full responsibility for her problems would have been inappropriate.
I needed money—Dad would have said I was broker than the Ten Commandments—so I went to get my old job back...
These folks "tough loved" Jim into sobriety.
Keeping these in mind and using his knowledge of Shaolin boxing skills as a technical point of departure, he is said to have developed a form of soft boxing called Tai Chi Ch'uan.
Perhaps the sage Sanfeng created soft boxing to use in increasing our store of good health (zizhu daoti).
The biggest fear of the adults and the audience was that they would fall prey to the gangsters who offered cars, zoot suits, and dough in exchange for a few minor “jobs,” but all they needed was a caring newspaper reporter, cop, or priest to tough love them onto the straight and narrow.
It is clear that the re-doing of the phasic structure of the cycle, according to an increase in pull time, occurs not only in the process of learning but also during improvement of motor skill.
The public has the impression that students are just taking a bunch of bird courses.
In principle, you could create a chart that describes the final tensions arrived at by using different combinations of tension and pull time.
Pitts said his whole family lends a hand when pull time comes around, including his grandson, Joe Buchs, a senior in agricultural construction systems management (ACSM).
A McGill University commerce student named Seymour Schulich was looking for a bird course to bolster his grades.
Some suppliers have an extended pull time due to poor automation.
In chapter three of Professors' Guide, the authors discuss the well-known strategy of students "larding up" their schedules with "Mickey Mouse" courses, which Taylor notes was unheard of in his day. "I don't even remember the word ‘bird course’ being around," he says.
Bingo bango bongo is a game whereby a point is awarded on each hole for each element of the bingo bango bongo.
You've thought there were some high souls that didn't do it—that wouldn't, I mean, to work the oracle, lift a little finger of their own. But, Lord bless you, give them a chance—you'll find some of the greatest the greediest.
It is his glowing eye and ingenuous smile that works the oracle, I fancy.
For example, if we had a collection of pairwise disjoint intervals of length 1/2,1/4,1/8,…1/2ⁿ,…,etc., then we would certainly like to be able to say that the measure of their union we is the sum ∑1/2ⁿ=1 which would not follow from finite additivity.
To show that all 𝛤ᵢ-translates of F_i, are pairwise disjoint, it suffices to show that all 𝛤_(i,0)-translates of F_i are pairwise disjoint, since then the argument as above will show inductively that the 𝛤_(i,m)-translates of F_i are pairwise disjoint for all m>0.

That said, going back for reservist training would without a doubt be a pain — digging up all your old gear, your uniform and your dusty field pack once a year is enough to make you wish you chao kenged during your NSF days.
But Sunderland fans fearing the worst finally had something to cheer when in the fourth of five minutes of stoppage time Gyan stood at the right place at the right time.
I would argue that those who 'slack' or chao keng are probably more a threat to our national security than a defaulter who has postponed his NS, but done well while in NS.
I'm willing to bet all of us have tried to chao keng our way out of work sometime in the past, myself included.

Most significant is the observation that the vaporous for the more volatile end member occupies a decreasingly smaller portion of the diagram as the other end member becomes less volatile. Ultimately, when the less volatile end member is essentially involatile, the vaporous of the volatile end member may become microscopically small.

Formal Concept Analysis is a mathematical theory of concept hierarchies which is based on Lattice Theory.
It is natural to think that the absence of phase transitions in the SU(2) theory can be generalized to lattice theories with any continuous non-Abelian gauge group.
Even when the wind blew cold, the fine sportsmanship and fellow feeling that is traditional to the Winter Games, lifted last week to an absurd height by the love-everybody snowboarders, the new let's do-right IOC and the continuing sympathy for the U. S. of A., was lovely to see — and to join.
… Floral Highnotes brilliantly combined opera and flower-arranging in what can only be described as a performance that was three stops short of Dagenham. Which is to say, for those not au fait with the London Underground, Barking.
If you invest in a business where even they say they won't make money, you're three stops short of Dagenham.
On the other side of the room, a crowd has gathered around a box of chocolate cupcakes filled with Marmite from chic London bakery LOLA's. It sounds three stops short of Dagenham (Barking), but, strangely, it works.

Oral gratification was offered almost continuously—between-meal nourishment, before-bed treats, chewing gum and toys which could be sucked and chewed.
I wanted to have a playdate today, but screw this, we could reschedule it for tomorrow.
These experiences left him with a rather unsteady control over his angry impulses, particularly when denied oral gratification such as a drink of liquor.
I was going to enter the competition, but thought, "Fuck this; nobody's going to know whether I did it or not."
Fuck this; I refuse to get you a game for this upcoming holiday because you behaved like an asshole this week.
Smoking is, at heart, oral gratification. There is, shall we say, a certain sexual implication in putting our lips around a long, thin object, ingesting its essence into the mouth, perhaps swallowing it, then expelling it.
But in happy news, she said that even though “I have balance in all aspects of my life except for love,” (womp womp) I haven’t met my twin flame.
And the half-reclining astronaut posture he is forced to adopt breeds sub-conscious fears that any minute now it may be chocks away and blast-off for the Moon.
Since the final "Chocks away!" was not given until after most schools had, perforce, completed their option choice procedures, the TVEI had to compete with choices already settled.

The patient is an unusual example of bilateral scleroderma en coup de sabre with distortion of both upper eyelids, and ocular complications.
The clinical picture was suggestive of a combination of scleroderma en coup de sabre and facial hemiatrophy (Parry-Romberg syndrome). Distinction between Parry-Romberg syndrome and linear scleroderma with facial atrophy can be quite difficult and it has been postulated that en coup de sabre type may actually be a forme fruste of progressive facial hemiatrophy.
'I shall beseech you' — that is question now / And then comes answer like an Absey book: / 'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command; / At your employment; at your service, sir:'

The works of Ehresmann [1957/58], Benabou [1957/58], Papert and Papert [1957/58] give rise to pointless topology, i.e. an abstract treatment of a class of lattices (the frames) extending the class whose members are the lattices of open sets of the topological spaces.

I shook my head at him to let him know not to wild out on her.

How do you accomplish a massive step towards global socialism? Well, what I believe is the most sinister recurring narratives of the left. They just tell you that you can't do it. You can't make it.
In a pitch for global socialism, masked in flowery language, Francis, who insisted on his way to the U.S. that he was not a liberal, said, “I would like all men and women of good will in this great nation to support the efforts of the international community to protect the vulnerable in our world and to stimulate integral and inclusive models of development, so that our brothers and sisters everywhere may know the blessings of peace and prosperity which God wills for all his children.” The pope says nice things about the poor, but the practical result of ditching capitalism for socialism will be more poverty, suffering, and death.

'What is written on the paper?' 'Don't rightly know, sir. I can reckon out my name and numbers of course, but I can't make out all that fancy clerkwriting. Or sometimes Portuguese carracks take them and the certificates say Bristol on them, I can make that out.'
Woe to those who act fraudulently, who exact their full measure when in receipt from others, yet give short measure when they reckon out or weigh out for others.
On the day of the patient's discharge, the patient will be called to 1 of the 2 dress-out rooms.

Monomial ideals and algebras are among the simplest structures in commutative algebra and the main objects in combinatorial commutative algebra.
Using techniques from combinatorial commutative algebra [MS05, KM], they showed that certain lattice games admit a particular type of algebraic decomposition known as affine stratifications, from which a finitely representable winning strategy can be recovered.
The students were required to analyze the article based on text type.
When the needle finally perforated the sac around the spinal column, clear fluid bubbled back through the hub. The resident congratulated me on a “champagne tap”, free of blood. We sent the fluid off to the laboratory.

Road trains are big rigs made of tractors that pull more than one trailer. [ … ] They are driven in remote areas of Canada, the United States, and Australia. Australia is home to the largest road trains in the world. [ … ] It is common for Australian road trains to have up to six trailers attached to a single tractor, with each trailer holding up to 140 tons (127 tonnes) of freight.
2015 Michael Whiting, "Leppa: Stick fat through the tough times" Brisbane Lions, 30 April 2015. Accessed 23 August 2018.
Livestock road trains tend to travel in convoys and its^([sic]) best to pull over for a rest and watch them pass.
I’m a good person for sticking fat? I’m a good person for acknowledging that even though my team seem to have completely missed all boats of skill and ability this year, I am a good person for still wearing the colours?
Where there are two semi-trailers and one motive unit this is called a double bottomed articulated vehicle or road train. Especially in Australia, road trains may consist of more than two trailers. In the UK, serious consideration is being given to their use on motorways.
It is a British publication, but not so slow as some colonials and a few United Statesers would have us believe British business men generally usually are.

"A judge will decide what is the most logical, although I'm sure to some judges [freezing the body] will seem like science fiction and a wild scheme," McDonald said. "Other judges make think this is a good thing. It will be a head scratcher for the judge."
Finite geometries, such as Euclidean and projective geometries, are powerful mathematical tools for constructing error-control codes.
The students had the chance to hear the stories straight from the horses' mouths in the field interviews.
We give a survey on a topic in Finite Geometry which has generated considerable interest in the literature: the construction of maximal sets of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) or, equivalently, of maximal nets.
Finite geometry is a broad area of research, but much of it is not Euclidean in flavour and no theory seems to match that of oriented matroids in establishing combinatorial Euclidean geometry.
He finally tumbled to our secret.
Some manufacturers isolated the electronic circuitry and hermetically sealed it in a metal capsule.

Speculative philosophy is the endeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted.
Although difficult to interpret, small shellies may hold the key to understanding the origins of shelled and biomineralised groups of animals.
Well, does the sea obey my commands? If it be my subject, it is a very rebellious subject. See how it swells, and dashes the angry foam and salt spray over my sacred person.
In the period before the wars, some of the speculative philosophies, including pragmatism, developed supernaturalist theologies and idealistic metaphysics, while others discarded these traditional views in favor of sweeping Spencerian or Bergsonian theories about nature.
His little red eyes—those eyes that had smarted under the salt sprays of every sea, that had looked unwinking to windward in the gales of all latitudes—now glared at Almayer from behind the lowered eyebrows like a pair of frightened wild beasts crouching in a bush.
It will be convenient to have a name for the ideas which are esteemed at any time for their acceptability, and it should be a term that emphasizes this predictability. I shall refer to these ideas henceforth as the conventional wisdom.

He stated flatly that he could not run his airline with the middle seats unoccupied, as it was simply uneconomic. Actually, he probably could, but he stood up to the Government and ministers wilted and simply acquiesced. We needed some strong figure in the [rail] industry to stand up to government, but there has been no one to knock on number 10's door and argue the case.

Mäkhtumquli avoids the altered syntax so typical of the Chagatay ghazal and in particular the Persian syntactic constructions. The relation of his language to classical Azerbaijani has been noted (Benzing 1964:39), and this is probably a result of the influence of poetic models in that language, seen also in the work of Andalib.
Then the following reports were made: “World-wide significance of Fizuli's Poetry” (prof.H. Arasly), “Questions of mastership in Fizuli's creativity” (prof. Mir Jalal), “Fizuli and the Azerbaijani music” (A. Badabayli), “Fizuli as the founder of the Classical Azerbaijani literary language” (prof. A. Demirchizadeh) …

Goffering is done with an Italian iron, but it is not suitable for narrow or very delicate frilling, as it produces a stiff effect.
Very little has been written about the history of goffering irons, and no examples of this early period have been identified in English museums. Most of what is known is to be found in Lindsay (p. 36 and figs. 194-206), who notes that the tools were also known as tally irons—a corruption of “Italian irons,” whence the process is thought to have come.
Not long ago, it was difficult to produce photographs of tiny creatures with every part in focus. That’s because the lenses that are excellent at magnifying tiny subjects produce a narrow depth of field.
Pilot beams, however, the foremost cross-brace of the frame, continued to be made of wood until almost 1900.
There was no discussion in the home Mosque, such stuff was put into the too-hard basket, and there was a complete ban on politics in the Deobandi Mosque in Dewsbury [leaving a convenient gap to be attended to elsewhere.]

One day there was a big cockroach on the wall and a woman hit it with her shoe and it screamed. I swear it screamed. That was about it for me. It was really a mind fuck.
A man who together with his partner - a few years and several hundred sketches ago - came out with the "agak agak" philosophy.
Yes, although I would like to think of it as "agak agak figures."
Armchair linguistics does not have a good name in some linguistics circles. A caricature of the armchair linguist is something like this. He sits in a deep soft comfortable armchair, with his eyes closed and his hands clasped behind his head. Once in a while he opens his eyes, sits up abruptly shouting, "Wow, what a neat fact!", grabs his pencil, and writes something down. Then he paces around for a few hours in the excitement of having come still closer to knowing what language is really like.

Class guessers for the Xerox tagger assign potential POS [part-of-speech] tags to unknown words according to a surface analysis of the word form. In addition to the common practice of mapping POS tags according to the words' suffixes, this implementation makes use of the case of the initial letter of a word, which is highly significant for POS assignment in German.

But it is important to realise that but for causation is no more than indicative of true legal causation.
One of them, a limestone-ostracon found in the debris which covered the remains of a late Roman fortress, is of special significance for Ancient North Arabian palaeography and dialectology.
But in important ways the ' but for ' test obscures the true role played by causal principles in assessing legal responsibility.

While on the subject, does anyone think that the days of Pagan's Paddock are numbered? Over the weekend, a number of clubs used this tactic, but it seems to me, at least, that if the defence can't break past the centre, the ball just goes back into the attacking 50, and eventually a score will happen.
But I now leave this great and wonderful call of Moses, to the sacred historian, whose pen is dipped in holy fire, and whose words are the words of God.
The good sister is there to minister to his spiritual needs, the nurse is there to bind his wounds, and the prostitute is there to spice up his bland sex life.
As with Moses, Holy Fire precedes the commission for duty. It is The Eternal Fire of Almighty God. It consumes all but is never burned out. “Our God is a consuming fire” (see Hebrews 12:29). Don't you want to be a part of this kind of uprising? It is radical. It is energized by the Holy Fire and Heat of God. It will one day fill the whole wide world!
To go even further, the issue concerning the influence of the emotional characteristics of orthographic neighbours has never been investigated directly to our knowledge.
“Ask any region rat,” said Langbehn, referring to denizens of northwest Indiana. “When the wind is off the lake, you can smell it all the way down to Crown Point. It’s like a sulfur compound, clearly a steel-mill smell.”
At the time being middle class in America meant education for the children and modern home conveniences, most basically, hot and cold running water.
Tens of thousands of longtime residents here proudly wear the region rat reputation, and they will never see themselves as anything else, until death do them part.
Productivity in running water is dependent primarily on attached algae, which is part of the periphyton.
The action of running water is such as to wear away the banks against which the current is directed, and therefore one riparian owner has no right to change the flow of the current so as to direct it against the land of the opposite owner.
Traditionally, starting from Euler, multiplicativity of arithmetic sequences is customarily expressed in the form of an Euler product factorization of the generating Dirichlet series. It turns out that in the situation of modular forms, suitable Dirichlet series constructed by Fourier coefficients of eigenfunctions of Hecke operators can be expressed through Dirichlet series formed by the corresponding eigenvalues.
We have now given heuristically a large family of multiple Dirichlet series, one for each simply laced Dynkin diagram.
Thus, in a given society, the authority of man over man is inversely proportional to the stage of intellectual development which that society has reached; and the probable duration of that authority can be calculated from the more or less general desire for a true government, — that is, for a scientific government. And just as the right of force and the right of artifice retreat before the steady advance of justice, and must finally be extinguished in equality, so the sovereignty of the will yields to the sovereignty of the reason, and must at last be lost in scientific socialism.

I first saw willets and bartramian sandpipers—called plover—the 13th. I saw a good many mallards, some widgeon and bluewing teal, four ruddy ducks (the only ones seen during the year), hooded mergansers, two sandhill cranes, and flocks of geese that looked very large to me, and they were when compared with what I had seen in old Connecticut.
But still on the pastures and prairies of the Illinois country are born, each year, a new generation of Bartramian sandpipers, shore larks, yellow-winged sparrows and grass finches—the names by which we knew them in a day long gone.

Nevertheless, the most disturbing aspect of this patient's life was his complete selfish, hedonistic, irresponsible, drifting, and aimless lifestyle, along with a complete lack of hold on life or on his self. His life history led us to study the fascinating concept of Bleuler's haltlose personality disorder, which came naturally as a comorbid diagnosis, based on some of the features now explained (Table 1).
Non-limiting examples of adult personality and behavior disorders that affect the central nervous system include: a specific personality disorder (e.g., paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, a dissocial personality disorder—such as antisocial personality disorder—an emotionally unstable personality disorder—such as borderline personality disorder—histrionic personality disorder, an anankastic personality disorder—such as obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, anxious (avoidant) personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, eccentric personality disorder, haltlose personality disorder, immature personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, passive-aggressive personality disorder, or psychoneurotic personality disorder); mixed personality disorder; a habit or impulse disorder (e.g., pathological gambling, pathological fire-setting (pyromania), pathological stealing (kleptomania), or trichotillomania); and Munchausen syndrome.

Vernacular architecture scholars have increasingly studied the products of automobile tourism, although often with a wink of the eye or with tongue planted in cheek.
The first challenge to encounter, when addressing a comprehensive understanding of the vernacular architecture problematic, is to try to understand the etymological sense and the epistemological mean of the term. This paper intends to approach the evolution of the ‘vernacular architecture’ designation, and to reflect about its current conceptual application, considering its most substantial ideological divergences over time.
Then, as the brain fog lifted a little and cleared away, his chin quivered and he went on : “ Oh, Daisy, Daisy ; it comes back to me now, the years that are gone, and you as you were then. ”
But poverty’s scourge is fiercest below $1.25 (the average of the 15 poorest countries’ own poverty lines, measured in 2005 dollars and adjusted for differences in purchasing power): people below that level live lives that are poor, nasty, brutish and short.
While the warm, lingering days of summer are doubtless a wonderful thing, the brain fog that can accompany surging temperatures is actually real — and it doesn’t feel so wonderful.
Large supermarkets usually have better purchasing power than small, local shops.
His house, not less, than his shop, was proverbially a liberty hall, where courteous and hospitable attentions were shown indiscriminately to all; and it is consistent with our knowledge, that not a few both of the Established and Episcopalian Churches, as well as among the various sections of the Dissenting body, continued on terms of cordial friendship and uninterrupted intercourse with him to the last.
“Damn Ray. Y'all fell all the way off when Charles got knocked huh?” Some said. “Y'all riding dirty now?
For several months he made a hand-to-mouth living from such petty thieving and black marketeering as was possible.
He let out a long slow whistle between his teeth, shaking his head. “Boy, you know how to pick 'em, don't you?”
"Jesus, Kozak, you sure know how to pick 'em. Promise me you won't go near him again."
This one-to-one correspondence between the set of positive integers and the set of pairs of positive integers indicates that the set of pairs is countably infinite. Since the set of positive rational numbers is a subset of the set of all pairs of positive integers, the set of positive rational numbers is at most countably infinite. Then, since it is also at least countably infinite, the set of positive rational numbers is countably infinite.
I sure know how to pick 'em. Except I don't know as I've got any credit coming for this one, because it's hard to make the case that it was me that picked her.
Instead of saying that the aggregate of natural numbers is countably infinite (see Chapter 24), one can use Cantor's symbolism and state that its cardinal number is א₀ (read aleph null). [ … ] Now the range of a random variable may be a finite set, a countably infinite set, or a continuum.
The term “countably infinite” would seem to suggest that such a set is infinite. However, the definitions of “countably infinite” and “infinite” were made separately, and so we have to prove that countably infinite sets are indeed infinite (otherwise our notation would be rather misleading).
Who then should determine basic needs? The answer seems to be the following: “The unequivocal answer is that the people themselves should decide on the scope, content and priority of their own basic needs”.
A polygon's or polyhedron's Euler characteristic is just the number of corners minus the number of edges plus the number of faces.
It may be that the name in the cartouche, at this period and in the reign of Sneferu, is in fact the ‘gold name’ (S.Schott 1956:71).

All of which means that the nice neat pattern suggested by other Tasmanian endemic birds isn't a template for all its endemics: did the turbo chooks evolve on the mainland (and, if so, why did they lose their flight powers there?) and later run to Tasmania, or did they evolve in Tasmania and cross to the mainland during an earlier glacial period?

An elaborate test of six samples of babbitt metals was recently made in England by a Professor of Engineering, assisted by a metallurgist, which was published by a prominent engineering journal occupying six columns with charts, tables and photographs.
There, a few yards before them, was the high road from Risingham to Shoreby, lying, at this point, between two even walls of forest.
Always use this "virgin" babbitt metal for high-speed shafts — those that spin at more than 2,000 rpm, such as cutter-heads on jointers and planers. Old babbitt metal, which may have been adulterated with lead, can be melted and repoured for less critical, low-speed shafts like countershafts and bandsaw arbors.
The supposed superiority of brass or Babbitt's metal lined boxes over iron boxes, in positions very liable to heating, lies in their greater softness and conductivity for heat.
Descartes extended this classification by introducing his set-square compass. This is mechanism of sliding set squares that "push" each other... .
So-called Babbitt's metals made principally of lead, and weighing six ounces per cubic inch, are dear at any price, when compared with the tin Babbitt's metals which weight but 4¼ ounces per cubic inch, and never heat or cut journals.

Chasing spirit moose is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon, instead of church. I don't mean to kill him, but to see through binoculars...
Chief Bob was able to share the significance of the spirit moose with me and some of the ways in which our business and the hunters could help to bring peaceful closure.
A northern Ontario couple was treated to a rare sighting of not one but two white spirit moose,' and they managed to capture the magical experience on camera.
In camp that evening the discussion turned to strategy for the campaign against the ghost moose. He was given to hanging out near the mouth of a sluggish stream which drained a big swamp far back in the spruce.
Its massive head, shaggy and white, fell out of an old '78 Ford pickup, as my friends and I sat on our ten-speed bikes listening to the three Americans drinking Coca-Colas outside Sam's Place joke about how they shot the ghost moose coming out of a swamp south of Pickle Lake.

He notes with some pride this prank was mild for a group of men who worked in constant danger and adds, "There is no question in my mind that you could get any of the river men back out here to run logs, probably for half the pay," he says. "River driving is just something that gets in your blood. I guess that's why I never left, even when the jobs went. And I guess that's why I've put so much work into the boom house.”

Propane (or sometimes propane/butane mixtures) is extensively used for deasphalting and produces a deasphalted oil (DAO) and deasphalter bottoms (propane deasphalter asphalt, PDA, PD tar) (Dunning and Moore, 1957).
By way of an example, we consider in detail the complex projective line C ℙ¹. [ … ] Thus via the function w_0 the complex projective line C ℙ¹ becomes identified with the "extended complex plane" (i.e. the ordinary complex plane with an additional "point at infinity"). 2..2.1 Theorem The complex projective line C ℙ¹ is diffeomorphic to the 2-dimensional sphere S².
Hence, C(𝛤) is an uncountable union of complex projective lines.
So when it suits this vested interest in Imperial Manila, we liberalize. When it does not suit them because it will compete with their cars, we do not liberalize until 1998.
The phrase 'Imperial Manila' is used throughout the archipelago to denote the capital-heavy decision-making and the imposition of the will and culture of the political and economic centre on the peripheries.
However, it is possible to characterize the real parts of holomorphic functions of several variables at least locally as those continuous functions such that their restrictions to all complex lines, not just to complex lines parallel to the coordinate axes, are real parts of holomorphic functions. The complex line in C ⁿ through a point A∈ C ⁿ in the direction of a vector B∈ C ⁿ is the one-dimensional complex submanifold of C ⁿ described parametrically as A+tB:t∈ C.
The question of finding different familes^([sic]) of complex lines sufficient for holomorphic extension was put in [12]. Clearly, the family of complex lines passing through one point is not enough. As shown in [16], the family of complex lines passing through a finite number of points also, generally speaking, is not sufficient.

If you go to Maracas Bay, have shark-and-bake, a spicy fried bread sandwich of fried shark with a variety of sauces such as tamarind, garlic, chadon beni.
Over the 10 week period the students were guided in the development of investment profiles for producing 6 products and or commodities: dehydrated hot peppers; dasheen leaves; pasteurized milk (using small scale equipment); sweet corn; Chadon Beni; and Red tilapia.
Formerly, the punishment for high treason was of a most barbarous character…. Women were burnt. A male traitor was dragged or drawn to the place of execution and hanged; but while still alive, he was cut down and disembowelled. His head was then severed from his body which was quartered. The head and quarters, which were at the Kings disposal, were usually exposed in some conspicuous place—the Temple Bar being a favourite spot—after being boiled in salt to prevent putrification and in cumin seed to prevent birds feasting on them.
Every week I buy my herbs—cive (as it's spelled here) and thyme (sold separately), parsley and chadon beni (a close relative of cilantro)^([sic, meaning culantro])—from the same Rastafarian farmer, who always welcomes me, though this market swims with shoppers, and commerce generally gets in the way of idle chat.

Direct Provision is being introduced by the Directorate for Asylum Seeker Services of the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform for all asylum seekers who arrive in the State on or after 10th April 2000.
We recently heard about a particularly daring espionage coup. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to listen to our panelists as they describe a tactic that even Matt Helm had never thought of.
Deputy Seán Kyne asked the Minister for Justice and Equality the number of centres under the direct provision scheme, administered by the Reception and Integration Agency, for refugees or asylum applicants in Galway and nationwide; and the future plans for these centres in view of the reducing numbers of asylum seekers and the need to reconfigure spending at his Department in line with the EU/IMF/ECB deal.

The First Dynasty kings, however, continued to be buried in the south, in the cemetery of their forefathers of Dynasty Zero at Umm al-Ga‘ab by Abydos, close to the town of Tjeny (called Thinis or This in Greek)—likewise not yet reliably located archaeologically—which in the Early Dynastic Period still served as the capital of the country alongside the White Wall.

Likewise, 𝛼^(2ⁿ)=𝛼, etc., namely, the elements are all expressed as powers of 𝛼 and because 𝛼^(2ⁿ-1)=1, 𝛼 is termed a primitive element of GF(2ⁿ). [ … ] Furthermore, if the irreducible polynomial has a primitive element 𝛼 (where 𝛼^(2ⁿ-1)=1) that is a root, then the polynomial is termed a primitive polynomial and corresponds to the polynomial for a maximal length feedback shift register.
For q a power of a prime p, let 𝔽_𝕢 be the finite field of order q. Its multiplicative group 𝔽^*_q is cyclic of order q-1 and a generator of 𝔽^*_q is called a primitive element of F_q. More generally, a primitive element 𝛾 of F_qⁿ, the unique extension of degree n of 𝔽_𝕢, is the root of a (necessarily monic and automatically irreducible) primitive polynomial f(x)∈ 𝔽_𝕢[x] of degree n. [ … ] Here, necessarily, c must be a primitive element of 𝔽_𝕢, since this is the norm of a root of the polynomial.
But suppose L'∈C_𝜈(S_0) so that operatorname det(L')=𝜂'𝜋 blacktriangleright 0 for some totally positive unit 𝜂' and so that L' is everywhere locally a primitive element of the o-lattice R_𝜈.

It has to be run eight hours after reaching 1,600°, as high oxygen contents of the bath are not permissible in an acid furnace, and for quite one to two hours an endeavour is made to dead melt, that is, deoxidise the steel.
As crucible steel is dead melted and killed to a point where it is absolutely quiet, the holding period is just another factor in emulating the crucible practice to produce quality steel.

Today, it is probably true to say that both varieties have positive prestige but for different reasons and to differing extents: attitudes to Swiss German, as the unifying vernacular that gives the German-Swiss their identity, are positive in every respect, while Swiss standard German enjoys widespread prestige only as a written form that enables them to be part of the international German-speaking community […].

The so-called higher level programming languages, like the various dialects of BASIC and PASCAL familiar to students in the 1980s, greatly simplified the business of programming, since it is no longer necessary—at least for certain purposes—to do what is now called "machine language programming," or what in earlier days was programming, i.e., employing the ones and zeroes now frequently viewed as rather tedious and theoretical …
Hiro Protagonist [in Snow Crash (1992) by Neal Stephenson] must win, one might say, on both Surf and Turf against the wonderfully evil Evangelist Minister R. Bob Riff and his allies, both in the world of violence, swordplay, and aircraft carriers and in the world of ones and zeros.
The definition of primary importance is of course the definition of "collective investment scheme" itself. That is to be found in s.235 of FSMA 2000.
But suppose there is a special and universal and innate language for thinking. Suppose, in particular, that just as computers have a language of ones and zeroes that underlies all of their programs and applications, there is an equally fundamental language shared by all humans: a language of thought (lot) ….
If a fund is structured as a collective investment scheme, it cannot be marketed to the general public unless it is authorized.
If you are a developer or an architect, you are one for a good reason: Your magic and craft is turning ones and zeros into a solution that makes life and work better.
When using polynomial bases, the first stage in computing the product of two elements of 𝔽_2ⁿ is the multiplication of two polynomials of degree at most n-1 in 𝔽_𝟚[x].
In contrast to the case of normal bases considered in Theorem 5.1.9, the dual basis of a polynomial basis is usually not a polynomial basis. [ … ] 5.1.13 Theorem [1265, 1298] Let 𝜃 be a root of a monic irreducible polynomial f of degree m over K= 𝔽_𝕢, and let B=1,𝜃,𝜃²,…𝜃ᵐ⁻¹ be the corresponding polynomial basis of F= 𝔽_qᵐ over K. Then the dual basis B^* of B is a polynomial basis if and only if f is a binomial and m≡1!!!!(mod p), where q is a power of the prime p. 5.1.14 Corollary There exists a dual pair of polynomial bases of 𝔽_qᵐ over 𝔽_𝕢 if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied: [ … ] .

We read about his DUI in the police blotter.
"If you talk to any of our readers, they'll have a favorite entry in the police blotter," says Nick Ehli, who has been at the newspaper 14 years, seven as managing editor. Everyone who works at the Daily Chronicle has done their shift composing the police blotter at one time or another, since it's a task given to newbies.
I think whatever kind of a frying pan we may be in now with respect to oversight might turn into a fire of old boyism if Congress became the court of last resort on all of these grants.
Plain old power, the way it is usually practiced in the traditionally male-dominated environment, is the stuff of old boyism.

His testimony was worse than science fiction: it was junk science.
The terminology "splitting field of a K-algebra" is motivated by the same terminology regarding a polynomial. A splitting field of a K-algebra A is a field extension K↦L such that A⊗_KL is split; in the special case A=K[x]/f(x) this is the same as a splitting field of the polynomial f(x).
Ex. 7.6. For a finite-dimensional k-algebra R, let T(R)= operatorname radR+[R,R], where [R,R] denotes the subgroup of R generated by ab-ba for all a,b∈R. Assume that k has characteristic p>0. Show that T(R)⊆a∈R:a^(pᵐ)forsomem>1, with equality if k is a splitting field for R.
Our field falls neither in the category of immediately acceptable DNA experts at one end of the spectrum nor in the category of the immediately unacceptable so-called junk sciences at the other end.
Every finite dimensional central simple algebra has a splitting field: moreover, if said CSA is a division algebra, then a maximal subfield of it is a splitting field.
Sister Cornelia was in the corner puffing and blowing like a porpoise as she made a new bastable cake, that she, bein' a County Waterford woman, like the "blower" itself, had introduced into them parts.
There was no show but the heap of sweet cake, not to mention all the shop bread, he brought from town. Bastable cakes would be too common for the likes of such a grand dance, a mhic ó! There was enough there to feed half the parish.
A bastable cake! It was bread, really, but because it was baked in the three-legged iron pot, called a bastable oven, and because of its nice round shape, Ma called it bastable cake.
The Christmas pudding was boiled in it [a flour bag] and then wrapped in another, dry one for storage, and it was wrapped around the hot bastable cake to soften the crust.
With each goose she placed a big brown bastable cake, and eventually everything, including my father's potatoes and turnips, was stored in the cart behind the jennet.
Since the 1830s, pro-British Ionians . . . took their cue from the colonial officers, who denigrated the Ionians, comparing them to the aboriginal groups like the Hottentots or Irish. Indeed, the British frequently referred to the Ionians as the "Mediterranean Irish."
‘As for Maclaurin's imitation of a made dish, it was a wretched attempt.’
My dear deceased mama used to say to me when I was young and cried b/c I was all Italian. . . "You're Mediterranean Irish and that's good enough" on St. Pat's day!

After Bohlan's home security system recorded a porch pirate stealing packages from his doorstep, he reported the theft to the police department...and volunteered his own doorstep as a place where police could leave "bait" packages to catch porch pirates.
My name is Tony Licari. . . . An Irish guy once told me I was "Mediterranean Irish." I guess that is slang for those of us with vowels at the end of our surnames.
A free imperial city held the status of Imperial immediacy, and was thus subordinate only to the Holy Roman Emperor, whereas a territorial city or town (Landstadt) was subordinate to a territorial prince – either an ecclesiastical lord (prince-bishop or prince-abbot) or a secular prince (duke (Herzog), margrave, count (Graf), etc.).
Bart Blandino . . . refers to himself as a Mediterranean Irishman—an expression which never fails to amuse us.
Verdun was an ancient bishopric and a free imperial city, which France conquered in 1552 (together with Metz and Toul) and made into a fortress to protect its eastern borders.
Like many free imperial cities, Augsburg in the early Middle Ages was an Episcopal city.
Like most adventure games, Phantasmagoria is a bit of a pixel hunt, so move your cursor around the screen to see what can be manipulated or examined in each room.
My commute drive time is usually 45 minutes, but it can be 20 if I leave at 5:30am.
Finding the solution to a puzzle involved figuring out how to move an object, or trying to decide in what sequence objects should be configured, or the frustrating “pixel hunt” (searching for the one spot on the screen that was a hot spot).
Though far less frustrating than many text adventures, point-and-click adventure games often featured at least a few puzzles with highly illogical solutions and frequently forced players to engage in a “pixel hunt,” which refers to the process of moving and clicking the mouse all over a screen in hopes of finding a missed item or other important “hotspot.”

Sir, we are getting more modern equipment. In some cases the equipment we are receiving is a little war weary. It does take some rebuilding and repair. … [W]e are doing everything we can with Air Force assistance to bring up the level of maintenance of those aircraft that are a little war weary.
I get some of my best thinking done during my drive times.
Even World War II, seen as the “good war,” found the American people quite war weary by 1945.
"But here, too, we are so war weary. Everything we hear on the radio or the television is nothing but negative," said John Stone.
Mornings and afternoons are called "drive time" because that is when most people are driving. When people commute they tend to listen to the radio, thus drive time is primetime when it comes to total number of radio listeners. During drive time, radio stations have a captive audience.
Consider this commentary from a world weary poet, Emily Brontë, a contemporary of [Arthur] Schopenhauer, from "I Am the Only Being" (17th May 1839): 'Twas grief enough to think mankind All hollow, servile, insincere; But worse to turn to my own mind, And find the same corruption there.

About three years ago, half of them had piled into a taxicab that subsequently got into a collision with another cab, which contained—coincidentally—the other half of the Melba family. Consequently, we had eight injured Melbas, seven cases of whiplash, six cracked ribs, five fractured wrists, four chipped teeth, three broken noses, and two uninsured taxis. And a partridge in a pear tree.
In fact the modern human beater — the fustian-clad yokel, with a long and stout stick and a stentorian cry of "Cock ! cock ! cock !" — has very long ago pretty well ousted the merry cockers or the more staid Clumber for driving the coverts; certainly an innovation not at all a desirable one.

Brynner used photography as a way to stay in love with his day job, filling hours spent waiting on film sets by strolling among friends and crew with a Leica slung around his neck.

Then again; what about those Indian shamans whose idea of a quick sure fire way to do a vision quest is to go stand on a mountain outcrop where lightning is about to strike, until they light up like Yule trees with static electricity, jumping off the rock to safety (hopefully) at the last possible moment?
[Heidegger] is trying to avoid any conception of time that begins with a distinction between time and eternity. On this understanding of time, classically expressed in Augustine's Confessions, temporality is derived from a higher non-temporal state of eternity, which is co-extensive with the infinite and eternal now of God.
Those without an outdoor tree can hang gifts indoors on the Yule tree, or go for a walk to the local woods.
Belt and Road can "solve global woes," according to state-run Global Times newspaper. "The ambitious plan is not empty talk," the official Xinhua News Agency declared, highlighting that China has already invested more than $50 billion in 20 countries along the routes
“Russia’s elites’ high expectations regarding Belt and Road have gone through a severe reality check, and now oligarchs and officials are skeptical about practical results,” said Alexander Gabuev, senior associate at the Carnegie Center in Moscow.
Chinese officials have repeatedly said the Belt and Road is purely an economic project with peaceful intent. But with its plan for Pakistan, China is for the first time explicitly tying a Belt and Road proposal to its military ambitions — and confirming the concerns of a host of nations who suspect the infrastructure initiative is really about helping China project armed might.

Reverse spelling is one example of the ability to reverse a sequential order that is difficult for persons with aphasia (language impairment) or other organic mental disorders (Bender, 1975). Reverse spelling has been incorporated into some screening measures for cognitive impairment (e.g. the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, see chap. 3) and examined, in its own right, in relation to age.

During the course of his looking into Abedin’s S.G.E. status, the senator stumbled upon an O.I.G. “criminal” inquiry, commenced in October 2013, about whether Abedin knowingly got paid for hours she did not work while she was on vacation and maternity leave.

Finding myself, the other day, in New London, Conn., the thought occurred that it would be a good time to pay a visit to my old friend, Henri I. Baer whose kennel of police dogs (German shepherd dogs) at East Killingly, Conn., was only an hour or so away.
The silence in American public discourse about the reverse one-drop rule as it governed Mexican Americans is significant.
For instance, we will take a police dog, and no doubt you are all aware, as I am, of the fact that the police or German shepherd is one of the hardest dogs that we have to treat.
“He's bust to the wide,” said Oliver. “Don't you agree, Wilfred?”, “I think he must be,” said Harrap. “I had it on good authority that the bank was clamping down on his overdraft. When he's finished paying both sets of costs he won't have any credit left.”

Contrary to popular opintion, the shepherd or police dog has not been crossed with the wolf, and has none of the qualities of such a mongrel.
What Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin have called the Sixth Extinction is the one now being perpetrated by Homo sapiens – or Homo insipiens as my old German teacher William Cartwright preferred to say.
By the mid-1920s, the annual registrations of German Shepherd Dogs surpassed 21,000 dogs a year in America and the breed had become one of the most well-known in the country. Unfortunately, to meet this demand for “German police dogs” too many puppies were bred indiscriminately and the breed's reputation suffered.

Having thus noted the distinction between Analytic Geometry and Geometry, let us note in what way it differs from Algebra.
Divorcing my wife cost me a small fortune.
“What's within reason?” “Hand-job, blow-job, full sex — straight, full service. Greek, maybe, if you're not too big. Golden shower, if you like, but not reverse. No hardsports. And absolutely nothing without.”
In plane analytic geometry, all the points and lines are confined to one plane.
Also consider that youth individuals are new to the iron game, so naturally they are not as strong.
Analytic geometry may be defined as the study of classical geometry by means of algebra.
A new steel-producing centre has arisen recently on the Great Bend of the Hwang Ho.
For the last 500 miles (800 km) of its trip to the sea, the Hwang Ho passes over a giant flat plain.
If I am not sure whether what I want to do needs planning permission, how can I find out? You can write to your Local Planning Authority and ask them to give you a ruling (or, as the Act [the Town and Country Planning Act 1947] calls it, a 'determination') whether you need planning permission or not, and if you disagree with their ruling you can appeal to the Minister.
I smirked silently, and said to myself, it all makes sense now; he is one sick ass bastard.

The real wealth of information that could be drawn from planning permissions and refusals concerning housing, offices, industry, shops, etc., remains a largely untapped source and a number of assertions appear in the daily press and elsewhere about delays in granting planning permissions which only too often cannot be either confirmed or refuted, let alone be judged against statistics showing the wider context of the implementation of planning permissions.
There are a couple of days in the week that are generally bad for a comic book store to serve its library clientele, with Wednesdays in particular being new comic book day (sometimes Thursday when Monday is a holiday).
Difficulties arise when a use is abandoned and resumed. The question is whether planning permission is needed for resumption. Where a new planning permission is granted and implemented, the old use rights are lost. Planning permission runs with the land once implemented; cessation of use does not prevent resumption later on (this is particularly important in mineral working). Whereas a planning permission may be replaced by another planning permission, which is implemented, it is normally only uses that did not originally have planning permission that can be abandoned.

The UK has possessed a land-use planning system since 1948 which allows substantial discretion in the consideration of the environmental implications of new development. It is possible for local planning authorities (LPAs) to prepare plans in which environmental policies are emphasised and to refuse development, or to impose conditions for planning permissions, for environmental reasons.
This might be a problem for you bourgeois people who think broni wawu is undignified apparel, and therefore, beneath you.
Northumberland County Council will need to grant itself planning permission to build the stations in its area (Ashington, Bedlington, Bebside, Newsham and Seaton Delaval) and will need to receive planning permission from North Tyneside Council for Northumberland Park station.
Monumental texts, in particular, tend to be composed in a more elevated and traditional register termed “Neo-Middle Egyptian” or “Traditional Egyptian (égyptien de tradition).” Biographical texts participate in this linguistic proliferation in complex ways, from the formal texts of Bakenkhons (no. 2), composed in “Traditional Egyptian,” to the mix of registers, from Middle Egyptian to Late Egyptian, in the biography of Samut (no. 11a; see 4.3).

With roots in Black Twitter, cancel culture is an unavoidable mainstay of our infotainment age. In an era of too much everything—TV, opinions, news—we’ve come to rely on a vocabulary of consolidation: likes, tweets, emoji. Cancel culture is one of these argots—a governor, a self-regulatory device I have come to wield with pride (if infrequent recklessness). In the collective, the gesture is absolute: we can’t. We’re done. And so we asphyxiate support from a notable cause or figure. Roseanne Barr referred to Valerie Jarrett as an ape? Cancelled. Harvey Weinstein was outed as a sexual predator? Cancelled.

Both helicopter and snowplow parents are raising children to believe they have few faults and will always be successful.
Text links, by their very nature, contain text (thank you, Captain Obvious).
When schools protect children from low marks they are acting as "snowplow" schools, just as parents can be snowplow parents by shoving adversity out of the child's path so they can have a happy life.
The larger of the two specifications is known as Wide SCSI-2 because it's wider (Captain Obvious rides again).
There appears to be no empirical research on snowplow parenting yet, but both parenting styles could be defined as versions of over-protective parenting, about which there is some evidence.
Texting and social media have allowed parents to keep ever closer track of their progeny. Snowplow parenting is an even more obsessive form.

Imagine a full binary tree in which the probability of getting from any parent node to one of its child nodes is 50%. Associate labels of '0' and '1' to the paths to the child nodes of each parent node. Then the probability of getting from the root to a leaf node is a negative power of 2, and the length of the path (from the root to that leaf node) is the negated base-2 logarithm of that probability. Now imagine a random bit stream in which each bit has an equal chance of being either 0 or 1. Think of the full binary tree as describing a Huffman encoding for a script whose characters are located at the leaf nodes of the said full binary tree. Each character decodes a string of bits whose length is the length of the path from the root node to the leaf node corresponding to that character. Now use "Huffman decoding" to convert the bit stream to a character stream (of the given script). The average compression ratio between the bit stream and the character stream can be seen to be equal to the information entropy of the character stream.

Another term commonly used for some German music from the 1970s is kosmische Musik (“cosmic music”). It was introduced by Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser to market krautrock artists like Ash-Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Klaus Schulze.

The Comstock laws that forbade the importation of contraceptives were never enforced against goldbeater's skins or their molds, so that throughout the decades when the laws against reproductive control were most stringently enforced a constant supply of materials ready to be turned into condoms was available.
The membrane had been used, perhaps since antiquity, to make gold leaf, which goldbeaters produced by starting out with a small ingot of gold and beating it thinner, then sandwiching the leaves between sheets of cow intestines, ultimately creating a stack of alternating goldbeater's skins and gold leaf that could be more than 100 layers deep.

Turn D, from outside backwards to inside forwards. This is also a heel turn, but is not so difficult as turn B; a considerable amount of practice, however, will be required before the skater will be able to do it with ease.
The former of the heel turns, called turn D, can be learnt without a fall if taken at a very slow pace; [ … ] if begun slowly and in the correct manner, it is not a figure which need cause a fall. This, unfortunately, cannot be said of the other heel turn, called the B turn, the pierre d'achoppement [stumbling block] of all skaters.
Sorry, but I have to cry off the game on Saturday, as my mother-in-law is coming to visit.
Heel turns are nearly a mirror image of toe turns: release the edge; pivot the back foot around the front; weight the heel edge and drive. [ … ] First, keep your knees bent and driving forward with the turn. Many beginners push the board away from their bodies in a heel turn, straightening their legs in the process. Instinct tells them that that's the way to get the board on edge. Instead, drop your hips to the inside of the turn and drive with bent knees.
Sorry, but I just don't think you have the eye-hand coordination to be a juggler in this circus.
More than any other episode to date, “The Last Of The Starks” heralds Daenerys’ heel turn. She’s been poised for it for some time, though the timing varies depending on the character perspective—Varys has always been ready to fly to another camp if he felt something was amiss or he just found a more viable candidate, while Tyrion [Lannister] and Jon [Snow] still want to serve her.

“I'm going to come. You need to stop unless you want me to do it in your mouth.” His voice was ragged and he was coming undone and I was thinking maybe I wasn't so bad at this after all and then his hand tightened on the back of my head and it was too late. I swallowed and then grinned up at him. “Spitters are quitters.” I rose to my feet as he collapsed on the bed again.
The taking of the spoils of war was important to both Muslim and Christian communities during the Crusades.

The intellectual Daniel Borrillo refers to liberal homophobia as that which accepts homosexuality so long as it is not discussed. This type of homophobia is represented in phrases like, 'I don't care what anyone does in private so long as they don't tell me about it'.

I pulled out my calculus book and started in on a basic question about limits.
She was always worried about Laura when she was in gymnastics. When her teammate died of complications from anorexia, she really started in on her about her weight.
Thiopentone is a short-acting drug – not a good agent to keep the patient anaesthetized for very long – so a switch must be made to another anaesthetic. The common one used in those days was ethyl chloride.
If the asteroid first has an interaction with the terrestrial planets, it is possible that its orbit can be altered in a way to pull it out of the main asteroid belt and reside almost entirely within the inner solar system.
The discipline which is the ancestor of modern specializations like astronomy, biology, physics and chemistry was then called natural philosophy.
The part which deals with Sounds, Inflection, and Word-Formation was written by the junior author, who is also mainly responsible for matters of orthography, hidden quantity, etc., throughout the book;

The light of the nouvelle vague—the “new wave” in French cinema that crested in the early sixties—was special.
As experienced political officers, Sir William Macnaghten and Sir Alexander Burnes should have been aware of what was going on in Afghan hearts and minds, but relations between the two men had become badly strained.
Unlike in Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan, in Yemen they are trying to implement sharia by winning over the hearts and minds of the people.

The mail fraud statute and its counterpart, the wire fraud statute, historically have been powerful instruments for prosecutors.
At the Bluetick Tavern, a bucket of blood hangout on the outskirts of Little Black Water, a haze of smoke clung to the ceiling joists.
The definition of algebraic structure establishes a framework through which to compare otherwise very different abstract objects, and to study similarities and patterns made apparent by the definition.
Then you said in your paper that there was a paucity of variety and the length of the programme made the latter part to say the least rather monotonous. Now those are big words for a little chap like me, but I say they are very unfair and very misleading.
The big words were beginning to sound empty in his mouth.
In this chapter we propose a general means for describing algebraic structures, both strict and up to homotopy, and we apply the results of the preceding chapter to the study of these [ … ] .
WATE-ON works because It is ultra rich in stamina.
Thus the algebraic structures which we have been studying are part of category theory, but the important theorem is not generally categorical nonsense, although there are theorems in category theory which we will not study.
Tucked into the YARD, TheT-MobileG1 Diner invited VIPs for breakfast and lunch, networking or just warming up with an ultra rich, extra hot cocoa (guests easily texted drink orders from the handy T-Mobile PDAs at each table.)
As a result, Treasuries, especially long-dated ones, became ultra rich and 30-year swap-Treasury spreads reached 150 bp.
Any algebraic structure is defined by a non-empty set of elements, and a set of rules or conditions that the elements satisfy. Thus, even a set equipped with a relation, as described in Section 2.4, is an algebraic structure. This structure is sometimes called a setoid, a name that we won't have much use for.
She introduced my low-income blue-collar husband into a world the working poor can only read about – the world of the ultra rich.
Wealthy interests can fund advocacy organizations with no disclosure of their contributions required. These kinds of judicial decisions bias the political process in favor of the ultra rich.
As Jorrocks expressed it, in the event of such a catastrophe happening, “It was all Lombard Street to a China orange we’d lose the number of our mess and sarve as food for fishes!”
Mora has been a favourite recreation with these people almost from their cradles, and he would be a bold man indeed who would venture to challenge a Torrese at this game, for the native's skill and experience are almost bound to tell eventually in his favour, and the odds are "Lombard Street to a China orange" against the outside player.
Norse Tradition is another similar term, but instead of being too broad, it[']s too narrow.
What though we can no longer perform signs and wonders by his influence; by faith we can yet remove mountains of sin and ignorance, and cast them into depths where they shall be seen no more.
Long before that year the Romans had had dealings with Mithridates²⁷ but they firmly held to the view that the first of their wars with the king was actually that inaugurated with the Asiatic Vespers and it was to that that they gave the title of First Mithridatic War.
The Norse Tradition, sometimes known as Odinism (after its chief god Odin), sometimes called Northern Tradition (as in Northern Europe) or Asatru (from the words meaning 'a faith in the Gods') is attractive today for many of the reasons for which it was followed long ago.
You may be an ace with a Rubik's cube, or even a yo-yo champion, but have you mastered that other geek hobby? You know, pen spinning?
While an entire book could be written about the spiritual symbols of the Norse Tradition, the purpose here is to give a brief description, without compromising the reader's own intuition concerning the symbols.
She was currently repeatedly spinning a blue pen around in her left hand, while her innocent-looking eyes were focused on the teacher, indicating that she was so proficient and used to the act of pen spinning, that not only did it seem like she could do it effortlessly, but she appeared to not even notice herself doing it at all.
When a service improvement process is first rolled out, the training sessions can be somewhat of a pep rally to get employees excited about the effort.
Toronto's Red Rocket streetcars are renowned worldwide as a symbol of our city.

You're 20-something years old, you've got your own house, different cars, money to burn.
For many young adults, if there is money to burn, it does not stay in their possession for long.
Implicit in this argument is the contention that the Philippines, while belonging to the United States as a sovereign, are not part of it; and that merchandise brought from the Philippines is an import because it originates outside of and is brought into the territory comprising the several states which are united under and by the Constitution, territory in which the constitutional prohibition against the state taxation of imports, is alone applicable.
A severely leaning tree which is greater than 12 inches on the stump can "barber chair" by splitting prematurely during the felling cut so that the butt of the main tree trunk pivots upward toward the chainsaw user's head, if special felling techniques are not used.
And unlike Jonah, dozens of my incisive life-affirming cancer-curing magnum opi are still entombed in the bowels of this pitiless machine and millions of respondents don't even know how disappointed they are not to read them.

[Rahim] Sterling was grateful that a glaring miss from [Jesse] Lingard's pass was rescued by a linesman's flag against the Manchester United midfielder, but he almost tried too hard as the game progressed and was running up blind alleys before he was replaced by Marcus Rashford after 68 minutes.
In the face of black swans — also known as fat-tail events, for the way their occurrences are distributed along a probability curve — market pricing may be impossible.
It wasn't bare knuckling in the traditional English sense, but rather a form of defense that spanned back into the religious temples of China, a combination of graceful self-protection and lethal attack.

Winter Finding.
I'm going to admit that the opening strains sound a wee bit "demo from a home studio," and that the title itself – paired with any other artist – would probably result in a side eye and a quip about done-to-death, cheese-pop metaphors.

I'm not sure the juice is worth the squeeze on this one ... maybe I'll just take the hit on the exam and learn it later.
We need to ask ourselves whether the juice is worth the squeeze. Let's say we have a perfect fraud model that can completely identify all the fraud occurring in a portfolio. However, if the model takes so long to run in production that it crashes the production system, that model is far from desirable.
Other names for Summer Finding are Ostara and Easter.

The Meteor, Group Captain [Hugh Joseph] Wilson said, puts its nose up at the shock stall, so that had the aircraft become fully shock stalled during the record runs, the pilot would probably have been able to recover without hitting the sea. But at the speeds achieved—the fastest run recorded being 983 kilometers or 611 m.p.h.—only parts of the Meteor (for instance, the area over the wind screen) were shock stalled.
Sometimes the pilot finds that his elevator or rudder is utterly ineffective. He moves the stick or the rudder pedals, but the aircraft fails to respond. This can be explained by the shock stalling of the fixed horizontal or vertical surfaces, in the presence of which the control surface moves in the wake and has no effect.
The dirtbag left may be seen as a case of bourgeois pessimism moving from the more laid-back image of dinner party conversation to a direct engagement with right-wing activism and Democratic Party sell-outs.

This association will partially pay for the repainting of hex signs in the tourist areas.
These flukes have three hosts. … As the infected snail crawls along it leaves slime balls containing cercaria on grass. An ant, Formica fusca, the arthropod host for D. dendriticum in the United States, is infected when it ingests the slime balls.

1996. What ‘Orthorexia Nervosa’ Means: Steven Bratman, MD, MPH, a California physician, coined the term in 1996. It means “fixation on righteous eating.” Since then, many medical professionals have accepted the concept.
Red Star over Europe: The Bolsheviks seized power firmly convinced that socialist revolution was imminent in advanced western countries. These, they believed, would come to the aid of backward Russia. Red Star over Asia: As the prospects of revolution dimmed in the west, Lenin looked eastwards to the backward countries colonised by the great powers. Here the struggle for independence might be combined with the fight for socialism.
Note the hex signs on the barn, an old Pennsylvania Dutch custom used to ward off the evil spirits.
The Funds have fallen again during the last week, and the reason assigned, is, the “unfortunate failure of the mediation of Russia;” just as if that mediation has, or ever has had, any thing in it, that promised peace to this country. It was an anodyne necklace, invented by Mr. Fox and administered to the nation with the concurrent opinions of Lord Hawkesbury and Mr. Pitt.

The duke of Brunswick... has caused real schools, in contra-distinction to verbal, to be erected at Brunswick.
After that vacation I feel like a million dollars
Like a Real School, real research is recognized as the genuine article, and persons engaged with it garner status and power.
In 1688 New York and New Jersey were added to the Dominion of New England, and there is evidence that Pennsylvania and even Maryland were to be next. But before these imperial plans could mature, James II was toppled from the throne by the Glorious Revolution.
After that vacation I feel like a million bucks.
The defection of the old 'country' Whigs paved the way for the prominence of a new generation of Whigs after 1690 (the Junto Whigs), whose views and attitudes were considerably different from those Whigs who had served their political apprenticeship before the Glorious Revolution.
The man rejected the business forum moderator's advice and decided to feed the troll by answering his irrelevant question whether he could host a game show.

Algorithmic entropy is closely related to statistically defined entropy, the statistical entropy of an ensemble being, for any concisely describable ensemble, very nearly equal to the ensemble average of the algorithmic entropy of its members; but for this reason algorithmic entropy corresponds intuitively to randomness rather than to complexity.
First, marinate the tofu. In a bowl, whisk the kecap manis, chilli sauce, and sesame oil together. Cut the tofu into strips about 1cm thick, mix gently (so it doesn't break) with the marinade and leave in the fridge for half an hour.
You could just use ordinary shop-bought kecap manis to marinade the meat, but making your own is easy, has a far more elegant fragrance and is, above all, such a great brag! Flavouring kecap manis is an intensely personal thing, so try this version now and next time cook the sauce down with crushed, split lemongrass and a shredded lime leaf.
The owner of the weapon assured him that he was as safe as houses
While 1:1-10 introduces the letter as a whole and not just chapters 1–4, a recollection of the theme of Christ's universal Lordship in the church to end off the first major unit is fitting and suggests that 4:14-17 is the end of the section.
The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!
