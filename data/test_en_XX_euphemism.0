You are getting 2 completely different concepts confused with each other. You are getting the fact that bankruptcy is reported on your credit report for up to 10 years mixed up with the effect that reporting will have on your credit. Just because something is reported on your credit report does NOT necessarily mean it will have a negative effect on your credit standing.

The way that this entire saga unfolded points to the work of a political master. While I have no love lost for the Susan G. Komen foundation, if I were their board, I would be angry and sheepish about having my organization used as a political stepping stone and then left as collateral damage for an ambitious self-serving culture crusader. Make no mistake: we've not heard the last of Karen Handel.

These results suggest investors drive stock prices too low in the face of bad news or uncertainty, and systematically pay too much for the promise of growth in an exciting company story. In the aggregate, Value stocks subsequently perform well off their depressed levels; but stocks valued richly for their rosy outlook typically can't live up to expectations and move lower as investor enthusiasm wanes.

Afghan civilians in proximity to alleged military installations will die, and must die, as' collateral damage' of U.S air attacks aiming to destroy these installations in order to make future military operations in the sky or on the ground less likely to result in U.S military casualties. The military facilities of the Taliban were mostly inherited from the Soviet-supported government of the 1980s which had concentrated its military infrastructure in cities, which could be better defended against the rural insurgency of the mujahadeen.

I hope you realize that the Daleks used to be humanoid in nature, in old, classic Doctor Who.
