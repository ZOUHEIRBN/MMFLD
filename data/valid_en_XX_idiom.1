The new teacher was so enthusiastic; I hope she can keep it up until the end of the year.
Ever hear of Viagra? It's not my fault you can't keep it up anymore.
Blinking and swallowing, she checked her list of questions. “What are some of your favorite outdoor and indoor activities?” “Well, whale watching is growing on me.”
I give my old clothes to charity when I've grown out of them.
Still, I see you mean well enough, and are merely suffering from the debilitating cheerfulness of youth. You will soon grow out of that.

My mother-in-law pickled walnuts, and covered floors in rag rugs, she bottomed the house each spring
I don't want to pay the freight on the kind of conspicuous consumption that thrives on Mercedes or Jaguars.
Stores that were large enough to pay the freight hired their own in-house detectives and security, but lots of companies were far too small to handle that kind of expense on a full-time basis.
And now Leclerc has won two races while Vettel is still to get off the mark this year. Looking at the remaining races - the tracks they are on, and the pattern of Ferrari's form - it is far from certain he will get another chance.

Rooney's sending off will be the main talking point, however, and his actions once again raise questions about his temperament that he looked to have gone a long way towards answering in recent times.
The hard-hitting, action packed, thud and blunder adventure fantasy was a commodity during that somber decade: Americans paid money to forget their troubles, and the pulps were willing to sell.
England manager Gareth Southgate will have struggled to decide whether his glass was half-full or half-empty as he reflected on a thud and blunder night against Kosovo at St Mary's
Two years into its first term the [Jimmy] Carter Administration developed a foreign policy that seems in perfect continuity with its six predecessors. [ … ] Little change has taken place during what has been called "the amateur hour" except for a slight quickening of the Cold War pulse.
The First World War may have brought, as Dos Passos maintained, an end to "the bully amateur's world," but amateur hour was already closing down as American soldiers struggled up San Juan Hill. Three books written between 1897 and 1899 are flashes that streaked the sky at the moment "the boy culture" of volunteers was displaced (and absorbed) by the "dirtywork" of regulars committed to the culture of management.
Next week, at some place in Indianapolis where time has been instructed to stand still, Mark Emmert, president of the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association], will convene what is being called, without irony, a "retreat." Assembled will be about 50 college presidents, pledged, it seems, to make sure that college athletics continue to remain firmly in the past, in the antiquated amateur hours.
"It's the kind of foul-up that suggests that his [Rudy Giuliani's] campaign team isn't functioning as well as it should," the G.O.P. source said. "Presidential campaigns are not the time for amateur hour."

This man has a forked tongue and lacks credibility.
Despite their careless scholarship and a less tangible quality that some would call a tin ear for poetry, Morris Halle and S. J. Keyser, as metrists, have the considerable virtue of explicitness.
Japan has often displayed a tin ear to South Korean sensitivities over the island, which it calls Takeshima, having acquired it in the process of annexing Korea.
With the economy as it is, I think the RMT has a tin ear to think it will find sympathy or public support for strike action. I hope sense prevails,
Everyone wanted to weigh in on what kind of car he should buy.
Everyone spoke freely, until the boss weighed in.
Having more or less approved [[w:Drexel Burnham Lambert|Drexel [Burnham Lambert]]]'s selection earlier, he [Peter Cohen, CEO of Shearson] now weighed in with what seemed a halfhearted endorsement of [Thomas] Strauss's [CEO of Salomon Brothers] stance.
It is absolutely essential to understand other’s motivations prior to weighing in.

[ … ] he put his head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone, he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn’t drop that.
“She said we were really the only people on the ship they cared to know.” “I shouldn’t have thought a missionary was such a big bug that he could afford to put on frills.”
Oh, and while you're here would you like me to look at your fanny? And the girl, says, Yeah, sure, might as well, and off they go.

In some smokestack industries—steel, machine tools and especially cars—the choice was to raise productivity and quality a lot or cede the field to the competition, as American companies did in consumer electronics.
State Senator McClintock appeared on CNN's Inside Politics on Tuesday and told me he had no intention of following Ueberroth's lead and ceding the field to Schwarzenegger: "I'm in this race right to the finish line."

Being a dentist isn't so glamorous, but it pays the bills.
The club's “partners” had made arrangements with the police, so employees were cop proof too. All this amounted to a ticket to ride for me. The party only stopped when I wanted it to.
Predictably in the second half it was the Potters, who went searching for goals as Fulham sat back to defend their lead.
I came across Bart on a week away, whoring and drinking mostly, heard his glib stories about where he worked, and there found my opportunity. His ego was my ticket to ride.

When you move to a new country, your first port of call is often the local police.
To find the meaning of a word, your first port of call should be a decent dictionary.
The quality-control department has left the building and anyone with a halfdecent memory of a half-remembered match is out there publishing his memoirs. The scraps, the scrapes, the sessions — oh, what fun we had. Except we didn't have much fun, did we? Most of them are poor.
Just as I can run through a long succession of too many negative "what if" scenarios, my mom is equally efficient at producing a long list of what could go right. Of course, she generally takes it a step beyond into the absolute impossibility of positivity after the logic train has left the building; I find her rosy interpretations rather annoying and frustrating.
Sales 1.0 —and its outdated and ineffective sales tactics— has left the building. Today's Sales 2.0 is fueled by tools.

Now we're getting down to where the rubber meets the road.

The business end of a hammer is known as the "head".
Speed by now was now down to 25 m.p.h., but that universal tool, the insulated screwdriver, with its business end gingerly applied to the relay coil, enabled us to keep going as far as Grantham, where a more permanent remedy could be effected.
On this day, with expectation rising and the unmistakable feeling around this sweeping Samara Stadium that the World Cup is really reaching the business end, England delivered.
Pardew was a member of the Palace side that lost in a replay to United at Wembley in 1990 and was in charge of West Ham when they were hit by Steven Gerrard's famous late equaliser in Cardiff that set the stage for Liverpool to beat the Hammers on penalties after a 3-3 draw.

So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms.
He and Victoria were as thick as thieves, and are about equal in wickedness.

This treaty is to all intents and purposes no longer viable.

Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use.
He hated the Professor, who smelt the rogue in him, and scourged him continually with his sharp tongue.
Mr. Thomas rarely misses a chance to use his sharp tongue. Republicans are terrified of him; Democrats call him a bully.

Yet give the devil his due; Says grace before he doth a deed of villainy.
And to give the devil his due he's finer than ever. Too damn fine for this crowd!
We are obliged, at least this once, to give the devil his due — and to consider the possibility that he may even be, in this instance, the angel of bleak truthfulness.
In his own ears the words he spoke rang hollow, awkward, even impertinent. He could say nothing which did not seem hideously supercilious.
His excuse about his daughter being ill again rings true, to me.

Having received an unearned windfall, we are in debt. The moral scales are out of balance. The canonical way to restore a measure of balance is to return the favor to our benefactor, as per symmetrical reciprocity. However, the canonical way is not the only way. Another way is to pass the favor on, as per transitive reciprocity.

OMB decided that a large part of the money would come from other health programs for poor women and children. That penny-pinching tactic sparked an outcry. [ … ] Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri denounced the plan as pitting "one city's babies against another city's babies." Florida Governor Lawton Chiles, who chairs the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, said it amounted to "robbing Peter to pay Paul."

She was a girl of imposing appearance and winning manners. But this staggered him. If she were such a slave to fashion and observance, she was not the woman for his wife.
The orders were simple: keep it plain, keep it proletarian. Apparently, Lenin was never a slave to fashion when he was alive, so officials thought he should not be one in death.

Athletes in these circumstances comment on the pain, but often refer to the experience as being "in the zone," a condition of distraction ...
Indeed, game researchers Bryce and Rutter (2001) reported that the feeling many gamers have of being in the zone (ie, totally engrossed, losing sense of time) is comparable to what athletes experience on the field.
These elements represent the essential features of optimal performances, which athletes have described as "hot," "in a groove," "on a roll," or "in the zone".

There are awkward grownup persons, having, as the French say, two left hands, whom no labour will ever make dexterous carvers;
"Oh Max, it must be true what father says, and I've got two left hands instead of one; what a scolding I'm in for!"
So, when the factory issued a requisition for ten workers, the commandant picked the worst candidates--sick people like me, and those schlemiels with two left hands and two right feet, who he knew couldn't get the job done.

The young man much resented this directness of attack, and in the war of words which followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult Mr Clare, without respect for his gray hairs.
The lower classes live in a state of war, a war of words. Their readiness is the product of the same fiery individualism as the readiness of the old fighting oligarchs. Any cabman has to be ready with his tongue, as any gentleman of the last century had to be ready with his sword.
[T]hese two have brutal, contemptuous wars of words — the kind you might expect from divorcing 40-somethings.

"Mirror in My House is both a portrait of the artist (O'Casey himself) and a portrait of an artist (a fictional John-Johnny-Sean Casside who contains multitudes), yet it is the unrelenting single vision of a particular personality with a fixed point of view."
"In taking on this new role, Boyd had learned that Les Miz's "bad guy" contains multitudes--not unlike the stars he sings about."
So, from the Jurassic Period to today, the problems that come with being secondarily aquatic seem to have had the same kinds of solutions. And what we've learned is that it's no easy task to get your sea legs. But once you do, it's smooth sailing.

I recognized him on sight.
"Permissive" working allows more than one train to be in a block section at one time but trains must be run at low speed in order to stop on sight behind the train in front. Such working is often authorised to allow freight trains to "bunch" together to await a path through a bottleneck instead of being strung out over several block sections, as would be necessary if absolute working were in force.
Thus I suspected that a trip to Chelsea might peg the needle on the religious experience meter but if biodiesel one wanted, that is where one got it.
The boy was left with Bob Yancy mainly because nobody else would take him. Them's the facts. Now go on!

Mr. Trudeau told reporters yesterday he made the decision to put an end to almost 16 years in office after a long, solitary walk Tuesday night through a blinding Ottawa blizzard. . . . "It was a great walk in the snow."
"I went for a walk in the snow last night—and I'm staying." So said Jean Chretien on January 15th, varying the phrase with which Pierre Trudeau announced his sudden resignation as Canada's prime minister in 1984.
Even in defeat, Ignatieff could not shake even one more Trudeau comparison. Trudeau's historic long walk in the snow came in February 1984.

Miss Lacy Stafford of Taylorville was struck by an Illinois Central train at the Sangamon street crossing at 3 o'clock and in the eyes of the spectators she was wafted directly into the sweet hereafter by lightning express.
People who don't come on strong aren't listened to. If you compromise, you won't get what you want. People won't take you seriously, or think you are a real man (or woman) unless you are tough.
Owing to his sugarcane habit, his stubby front teeth are all pretty much gone to the sweet hereafter.
So you can challenge initial dominance and come on strong to take over by the end of a debate, meeting, or conference.
You don't have to come on strong at first. Don't say things like, “I could totally see us married a year from now.” But let that person know you're ready for a relationship. See where she is. Talk.

Later American literary stars like Hemingway, Faulkner, Sinclair Lewis and John Steinbeck, Nobel Prize-winners one and all, never had more than a spoonful of the great gouts of fame that Twain — and Mrs. Stowe, for that matter — enjoyed everywhere in the world.
I really don't want to buy anything. You seem by bad luck to be stocked up with just the sort of things I wouldn't be seen dead in a ditch with. I can't stand rubber rings, never could. I'm not really keen on buttonhooks.

"Godzilla" is one of the classic creature features.
Her lover, cheek by jowl with Maria, at the head of that army of Portuguese ragamuffins, was not a pretty sight.
The Tariff Bill was rounded into shape for final passage by the House last week. It was not a pretty sight for soft-hearted political theorists.
They showed little remorse in using this power to its full extent, against each other, against smaller producers and against the laboring poor, including strong-arm tactics of no legality. The result was not a pretty sight.
B: Your ass.
The remote area will offer astronomers a ringside seat for the sky spectacular.
“Humph,” he says. “Did you ask for extra soy sauce?” ¶ “Yes. Dad. It's in the bag,” she says, rolling her eyes at me. “Well, in other news, the kids I cast as Emily and George are amazing!” ¶ My grandfather's head snaps up. "You're doing Our Town? That show is a snooze.”
There were, besides, some little pleasures in the shape of helping her to vegetable she didn't want, and when it had nearly alighted on her plate taking it across for his own use, on the plea of waste not, want not.
I'm a believer in “waste not, want not”, and we roast our leftover bread, finely sliced and brushed with olive oil, in a low oven.
I have two other philosophies. One is: Do the best you can with what you have. The other is: Don't worry about water over the dam.
The Canada Institute, part of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, has hit one out of the ballpark with its Montreal fundraiser.
It was reserved for Christians to torture bread, the staff of life, bread for which children in whole districts wail, bread, the gift of pasture to the poor, bread, for want of which thousands of our fellow beings annually perish by famine; it was reserved for Christians to torture the material of bread by fire, to create a chemical and maddening poison, burning up the brain and brutalizing the soul, and producing evils to humanity, in comparison of which, war, pestilence, and famine, cease to be evils.
The round calabash is a perfect image for the feminine womb, within which the arduously pounded taro is contained and then offered as the very staff of life.
Corn was the staff of life for many Indian people before contact, and it became the staff of life for many European colonists. Corn was higher in nutrition than most other grain crops. John Lawson, who travelled in South Carolina and into the interior Indian country in 1701, was one of the many colonists who sang the praises of corn.
He yelled silently at R. Daneel: Machine!
Shut up, he yelled silently as the woman cried out in pain and terror in the cabin behind him.
Hurry, he yelled silently to the pilot. Hurry!
He wouldn't have thought her such a cold fish. Pity. Still, there was plenty of time. Perhaps when she got used to his company she would thaw a little.
You're a cold fish. You have no heart.
You don't need special tools for this; any old hard surface will do.
This wasn't just any old fan, but the president of his local fan club.
All this was broadcast on the evening of 23 February 1956, and it's the earliest surviving example of an Independent Television News bulletin. Even then, there was an ‘And finally...’ item, but on this occasion it was merely the good news that a thaw was on the way.
Racing domestic animals in funny costumes on soapbox sleds is surely no more offensive than watching David Blaine take a dump in a Perspex box, and will look much better as an ‘And finally...’ on the news.
The shots were included as part of BBC natural history producer Fergus Beeley nature diary from Beinn Eighe’s National Nature Reserve show water being blown back uphill on a windy day in Torridon. They have been picked up by the media as an ‘and finally’ and widely circulated.
As a campaigning politician, he really knew how to shake hands, kiss babies, and work the room.
In show business parlance, Miss Hudson knows how to "work the room." Her comic turns are as rooted in vaudeville as her high-style wit is straight out of the smart supper club circuit.
On the outside, the Trans-Am still looked like a rusty bucket of bolts, but if all his little adjustments kicked in as planned, the thing should take off like a rocket.
"Why should I shake his hand? He called me a melon head." - Miami Herald, 1992
Second, despite constitutional guarantees of religions freedom and practice, and despite the rhetoric of tolerance with which religion in American society is cloaked, "coming out of the broom closet" and declaring oneself Wiccan or Witch remains a very risky act for many people, precisely because of the different cultures in which they reside.
I cannot claim that I ever came out of the broom closet, because I didn't even know that I had the option of hiding in said closet when I began to self-identify as a Pagan at the age of seventeen.
Well this sure ain't no E ticket.
The water swirling gently at the base of the muscular willow crowding the brook was the color of pea soup, and so deep that the bottom was invisible—a feature so dramatic on this small ribbon of water that it qualified as an authentic "honey hole". This is the angler's catch phrase for one of those rare, reliable places that always hold fish.
While humping her on the side of the road, she died one day. [ … ] He saw the big eighteen-wheeler coming, but her back was turned, and she saw nothing. He was suddenly scared, which helped obtain his freedom from her honey hole.
Merlin hesitated a moment or two, and I was on pins and needles during that little while.

We got all the roofing removed, but the chimney was damaged and we discovered that some rafters had to be replaced. One step forward, two steps back. Or maybe three.
This vase is not worth a dime. Why did you pay so much for it?
His opinions aren't worth a dime.
Eight of the nine who got damages were not worth a dime, and all but six of those who failed to sustain their suits were worthless.
It is extremely vital, because without demonstrating performance and excellence, all the philosophies and reasoning discussed and embedded in the previous two phases are not worth a dime and will look hollow.
Why is he here? Nothing will change. At best, he'll make a dime's worth of difference.
But why, he asks, should a similarly rapt and adoring crowd bank up before a lighted wall niche containing nothing but a dime's worth of daffodils and a couple of sprays of forsythia in a blue dish?
Those files were wiped off the face of the earth.
Residential C-banders have been, and will continue to ride on the back of commercial C-band technology. And with millions of dollars' worth of C-band birdies orbiting our planet, I believe it is highly unlikely the programming choices will become reduced.
But now vaccine doubt is spreading faster and further than ever through social media, and populist rightwing politicians in Europe and the US are riding on the back of a wave of mistrust of vaccine science.
That disguise is a dead giveaway! Choose something less obvious.
Instead of slowing down his arm when he throws it — a dead giveaway to hitters — Igawa had better arm action, Eiland said

I envy how obviously homemade it is, and how the 12 pounds of sprinkles dumped on top of it make it look like a tray of unicorn vomit.
"Well, it's awesome," I say, thinking "awesome" is a generous word for a scarf that resembles unicorn vomit.
Stop playing games with me and tell me the truth.
"Accusing Governor Carey of playing games with taxpayers in his $12.7 billion budget, the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton, said today that it would face rough sledding, in the Republican led State Senate." - New York Times, 1979
We're running out of money. It's going to be rough sledding from now on, but we'll have to cope.
Rudy's team did not handle last weeks discovery well. They are in for 30 days of rough sledding.
I sat at dinner, but satisfied myself with nibbling bread crusts, and witnessing the forlorn and perilous efforts of my friends to walk the line between starvation and acute indigestion.
“Hide!” cried Ebony, with a roll of his huge eyes, as he suited the action to the word, [ … ]

"Only force of habit will explain why people today do honor to Christopher Columbus." - New York Times, 1937
The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order.
There is a bowl of what looks to be unicorn puke on one of the snack tables and I decide I will be the one who dares to try it. I dip the serving mug and pour the contents into my glass. A small crowd gathers to see if I will die. I sip. 'How is it?' a scarecrow asks. 'Fantastic,' I say. 'But I don't think it has alcohol in it.' 'I think it's just rainbow sherbet and Mountain Dew,' someone says. It's getting hard to tell who's who. 'I can fix that,' I say. I grab a bottle of vodka and tip a lingering pour into my unicorn puke. It adds just the perfect bite to the mix.
“Are you eating a pink glitter cupcake?” (..) He nods. “Honey, you wish you had this much fun right now.” She rolls her eyes. “Really? You're gonna eat that unicorn puke?”
Armenia was good at removing kebab.
That’s a title the US appears on course to lose – a fall from grace that may prove irreversible. The domestic debacle unleashed by the pandemic, and global perceptions of American selfishness and incompetence, could change everything.
United were reduced to 10 men when Jonny Evans was sent off early in the second half but City's superiority was such that they looked on course for a landmark victory from the moment they took the lead.

It is the sort of paper which the father of the family is expected to take home with him from his office and read aloud to the chicks before bed-time. It was founded by its proprietor, Mr. Benjamin White, as an antidote to yellow journalism.
In the heyday of yellow journalism, newspapers like Joseph Pulitzer’s World and William Randolph Hearst’s New York Journal sent out squads of reporters to hunt down leads and, if evidence failed to materialize, make up stories.

One of the oddest spectacles in America, in fact, has to be a Tom Jones audience, in which a couple of dozen women, usually attractive and well dressed, throw their panties onto the stage and compete for what appears to be a deep kiss from the male master of the bump and grind.
A dozen exercisers show up twice a week to "bump and grind," "do some belly rolls" and "loosen the hip joints."
Early on, the film even blunders into outright hackwork, employing laughably literal-minded needle drops. Given the thorny intelligence of Chandor’s previous films (which also include Margin Call and A Most Violent Year), it’s hard to believe that he thought it was a good idea to play Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain” over a sequence of Pope telling the others that he can’t do this job without them, or to accompany shots of the men running through the jungle with Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Run Through The Jungle.” (Okay, they’re stealthily walking. But still.)
There are purists who climb the walls when German Conductor-Organist-Harpsichordist Karl Richter performs Bach. . . . To them, imagination—and Richter has plenty—is the ultimate transgression.
Or maybe we could locate a place to camp and fish that would be close to your mother. The area wouldn't be as nice, but we could still be outdoors and meet other needs as well. And the boys wouldn't be climbing the walls.

Heimdall is the watchman of the gods. . . . So acute is his ear that no sound escapes him, for he can even hear the grass grow and the wool on a sheep's back.
A suburban arena that was so sepulchral you could hear the grass grow.
He was quick to appreciate Blankenhorn's engaging personality and intelligent use of his skills. Chief among these was a remarkable ability to keep track of developments—to ‘hear the grass grow’.
And, whereas the mind of Man, when he gives the Spur and Bridle to his Thoughts, doth never ſtop, but naturally ſallies out into both extreams of High and Low, of Good and Evil, his first Flight of Fancy commonly tranſports Him to Idea's of what is moſt Perfect, finiſhed, and exalted; …
Who might not, by a very easy flight of fancy, have believed that everything about him took this haunted tone, and that he lived on haunted ground?
No German troops were mobilized along Canada's border last week, no Canadian cities had been bombed, and only by the remotest flight of fancy could alarmists see the Dominion as a battleground.
A Salesman Unaided by the House is Pushing Water Uphill.
Without that commitment you will be pushing water uphill the whole time and will lose your own, necessary motivation.
2005, Jeff Sabatini, "2006 Lexus RX 400h: The hybrid emperor's new clothes," New York Times, 31 Jul.,
Our relationship with Donovan Leisure was doing well, in truth because Rod Hills and I worked so hard on it, but often it felt like pushing water uphill.

"I wish—When shall we have courage to marry, Jude?" "Whenever you have it, I think I shall. It remains with you entirely, dear. Only say the word, and it's done."
"A primitive fellow. I'll kick him out if you say the word, my dear."
The American economic system is beginning to resemble the caucus race in Alice in Wonderland. Is it not something of a contradiction to cut taxes to facilitate the resurgence of buying power that will increase the demand for appliances and, especially, vehicles —and at the same time enforce a reduction in demand for the petroleum fuels that must drive the cars and power the machines that will manufacture the appliances?
What do you want? You want the moon? Just say the word, and I’ll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.
A more free and easy attitude prevailed in selecting research topics than today, when the funding squeeze keeps most academic scientists in a tight caucus race of grant getting and paper production that precludes forays into risky serendipitous pursuits.
You have to hand it to Curtis Joseph. Not only does he keep pucks out of the net, he keeps secrets too. "It's taboo," said Joseph, grinning like the cat that ate the canary. "You're not going to get anything."
So I close by saying that I might have had a tough break, but I have an awful lot to live for.
When you pulled that job in Westchester two years ago, I'll admit you got a tough break.
I stood there looking like the cat that ate the canary. . . . But he knows me too well and pondered out loud what I had been up to.

The high street was a place of utility once, with concentrated amenities. It was a place of wildly fluctuating codes of behaviour and scruples. Particular smells. Finicky proprietors. Honest johns. Crooks.
If the current trend toward relaxation of concealed-weapons laws continues, soon the most important gun restrictions may involve destinations: the states will probably allow various venues—public gathering places, offices, stores—to ban firearms on the premises. The only problem will be how to know who is packing heat.
It will do little for the future of immunization to prepare excellent vaccines, test them to a fare-thee-well for safety and efficacy, and then not insure that they are adequately used.
There seemed to be a shared perception of Colonel North as a good and honorable serviceman who had been left to twist in the wind, the scapegoat of an operation gone awry.
McGuinty just says, "Don't worry, the investigation will be over soon enough, we'll do something in due course," and people are expected to twist in the wind in the meantime.
"What do you see?" Thayet wanted to know.
The company's third loss warning in two years raises the spectre of eventual collapse and bankruptcy.

Sky News fell foul of its own woolly reporting on Tuesday, when it reported "human remains" had been found on Saddleworth Moor.

Bill Clinton was in full campaign form Tuesday. Hours behind schedule, he stopped to press the flesh with everyone in sight.
Wars of succession are rarely pretty. The heirs apparent of Moghul emperors in 17th century India used to take care of business simply by murdering all their relatives the minute the ruling emperor started to look ill.
Rather than attempting fertilization in a Petri dish, he simply loaded the sperm and eggs (known to biologists as gametes) into a fine pipette and inserted them into the Fallopian tube, where he hoped they would take care of business by themselves.
You've got a head on your shoulders, you have! I guess you'll fill the bill.

She [Thelma Golden] wanted to emphasize that postmulticulturalist African American artists had both benefited from and wanted to move on from that narrow focus on racial content over formal quality. She certainly didn't mean to suggest that racism had gone the way of the dodo bird or that race was no longer a concern of these artists—in fact, quite the opposite.
The reason that so many were fleeing the land was simply that small family farms were going the way of the dodo bird.
During Reconstruction, after [William Tecumseh] Sherman had torched the place, the planners decided to let the old historic landmarks go the way of the dodo bird; and over the next century and a half Atlanta got tarted up in steel and glass.

By proposing to eliminate Title II programs for fiscal year 1992, President Bush is sending America's colleges and universities, and those they seek to educate a most disheartening message: that he is willing to mouth the words “educational excellence,” but he is not willing to invest in the programs that can make such excellence realizable.
his vacancy opened the door for young people who wanted a position
The first reason Powell gave to explain Carter's press miseries was the idea of "blood in the water"—that more bad press goes to those who have just had bad press. Almost nobody in main-stream politics is as likely as a fourth-year incumbent to have just come off a stint of bad press.
But Justice won the Intuit round, and now Microsoft-baiters want to block deployment of the Microsoft Network. As a recent article in the Wall Street Journal aptly noted, competitors sense blood in the water.
[The] Democrats smell blood in the water. Twelve long years sitting on the sidelines. Twelve lean years. Twelve hungry years.
If you mistakenly referred to your rifle as a gun, you found yourself doubling around the parade ground with your rifle in one hand above your head at the high port, and your other hand clutching your balls.

Here he ran out of words, and drew himself up, beard at the high port, shaking his great head while he clasped my hand, and I meditated on the astonishing ease with which strong men of Victorian vintage could be buffaloed into incoherent embarrassment by the mere mention of feminine frailty.
We can all surely see, though, that there will be heads who will weep for joy at the challenges posed by LFM, which may yet provide for the apotheosis of those colleagues who want to see a full exercise book before issuing a new one. Calculators at the high port they will prowl their schools switching off lights, cutting pencils in half and pondering the cost-effectiveness of — as an ex-colonial head with whom I worked longed to do — deterring vandals by establishing a family of baboons in the school grounds.
Thomas Tring, emerging with violin in left hand and bow vertical at the high port in his right, looked about Clark's age, had a long head with thin untidy hair round a clear parting. His accompanist, two yards behind, was ruddy-faced with glasses …
The warden had spotted them. Mouth open in a predatory snarl which showed a metal tooth which it was rumoured actually grew there, she advanced towards them, her note-book held before her like a buckler, her pencil at the high port. The men turned and looked at her. That was all. Just looked.
Eventually he went off, still bubbling with enthusiasm. When his motorbike was out of earshot I went to look for Smithy. He must have taken off smartly at the high port as soon as he saw Elmer but I ran him down in the end.

"We were just blatantly flaunting our freak flag," she says. "We were trying to be badder than anyone else—and we were getting away with it!"
le Corbusier and his clients were, for a brief while, among the few who continued to ride the crest of the wave following the stock market crash of 1929. The architect was besieged by commissions to create luxurious residences.

Friends that I had lost touch with years ago suddenly found me again.

He lay down, cuddled the blankets up to his ears, closed his eyes and composed himself to sleep, at peace with his conscience and the world.

From the late 1950s to the early 2000s there has been a Parsonian normative solidarity between the state and civil society actors, a pact of silence that guarded the extent of periodic race crimes during the Ottoman and Republican eras—that is, the Thrace events of the 1930s against Jews, the Dersim Genocide, the Kurdish deportation in the late 1930s which included the deportation of “the remnants of the sword” (the leftover Armenians), the Wealth Tax on Minorities, Twenty Class Conscriptions of Armenian, Greek, and Jewish soldiers, the Istanbul Pogrom of 6–7 September 1955, the 1964 Greek Deportation, the Çorum, Maraş, and Sivas massacres, and the internal displacement of Kurds due to the Turkish-Kurdish war over the last thirty years.
It's in the nature of politics, and certainly the presidency, to go through rough patches – times when, because of a boneheaded mistake, an unforeseen circumstance, a sound but unpopular decision, or a failure to communicate – the headlines turn sour and the public finds you wanting.
Out there in Breughel, N.D., surrounded by an ocean of durum wheat, we got three squares a day, piled our plates and cried Yes! to seconds.

In both samples, hierarchic self-interest, a syndrome of self-enhancing value orientations, sometimes called an ‘elbow mentality’ [Hadjar 2004] or a ‘capitalist mentality’ [Boehnke and Dragolov forthcoming], negatively predicted generalised trust, though once again the effect sizes were quite low.
We believe in high fives instead of elbow mentality. This means above all that we help each other, celebrate our successes together and treat each other amicably.
The government of William Ewart Gladstone may not supply the people, as the Roman emperors did, with "bread and circuses," but if giving them plenty to talk about can satisfy a nation, we Britishers ought just now to be very happy. A whole week is never permitted to elapse without some piece of political gaucherie being enacted for the public amusement.]
But is populism actually popular? Or is it simply sedative patronisation, bread and circuses devised by a cynical caste of free marketeers who presumptuously underestimate the collective intellect?
When I was born, family and friends came from all over, thanks to the bush telegraph. There were very few telephones where I grew up, so my father mentioned my birth to someone at the market. And that woman told a man who was delivering rice to a place up the road. He told someone there, who was taking a herd of cattle south, toward the villages. And pretty soon the news of my birth had spread far and wide.

It's voters who seem to want Republicans and Democrats in the next Congress to cross the aisle and try something different in Iraq.
The British prime minister doesn't need any support from the opposition party; he has a ruling majority by definition. The American system, by contrast, is one of shared power, overlapping functions, and checks and balances. Progress requires broad coalitions between the two parties and politicians who will cross the aisle.

A steaming pile of toilet humour might not be everyone's cup of tea, but there's no denying the hilarity in some of these messages from beyond the bowl.
