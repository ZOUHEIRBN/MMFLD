It was so absurd that Romney didn't fight that lie, and he paid dearly for it. Lastly, I will say what I think are "inhumane" policies towards undocumented workers. It's inhumane to fight sealing the border when Mexicans are exploited, abused, and even killed by those taking them across. 
The lie, you see, was not completely implausible and may even, in some cases, have been not entirely unrelated to the truth. Today's sellers of Ford pre-owned vehicles, however, don't bother with plausibility even to this limited degree. They tell us that their used cars were "not just pre-owned, but pre-adored, pre-worshiped and pre-babied by their owners." Sure they were.

In many countries, the HIV epidemic is concentrated in subgroups of the population whose behaviour exposes them to a high risk of acquiring HIV infection.

People with privilege, either racial or class/economic, can refuse to cooperate and have that refusal be seen as exercising their rights. Unfortunately, most of the time when people of color or or lower SES exercise their right to not cooperate, it's most often seen as "resisting arrest" or refusal to cooperate for nefarious reasons.

Mary, You are familiar with rhetoric, aren't you? The examples I have read re: women incapacitated are along this route (a great majority at least): Functions X and Y are presumed to be given equal response for similar situations Z. If X is presumed at fault for situation Z, then Y should be presumed at fault for situation Z. The reason they are saying this is because, in this case it is heavily presumed at this date that a woman can not give consent when inebriated. The commenters are not loooking for an excuse to get women drunk and take advantage of them, they are looking for the opposite reaction of men getting the same courtesy in the same situations.

In conclusion, considering that HIV epidemics tend to be concentrated in hard'to'reach subpopulations such as FSW, more efforts should be made by governments and other organisations to obtain reliable estimates of the population size of these vulnerable women in different areas of their country.

This song is about a girl trying to convince a guy to "Go all the way," meaning to have sex with him. Carmen told Blender magazine in 2006 that he was inspired by The Rolling Stones performance of "Let's Spend The Night Together" when Mick Jagger had to sing it as "Let's spend some time together." Says Carmen, "I knew then that I wanted to write a song with an explicitly sexual lyric that the kids would instantly get but the powers that be couldn't pin me down for." 
"Navigating this fine line," he went on, "reveals a truth that makes people scream' reverse racism.' Having white friends, as a person of color, can be exhausting.

One final general point before turning to the specifics. People who have looked at this document in the past often asked whether progressive taxation reduces some of the income inequality that exists before taxes are paid. The answer: not by much, if we count all of the taxes that people pay, from sales taxes to property taxes to payroll taxes (in other words, not just income taxes). 
bundling is there wether you talk about Elsevier, Springer, Wiley-Blackwell or other big deal providers... It is always possible to buy on a per article basis or get personal subscriptions to specific journal.

As low as a few cents per article downlowded even if some journals are never actually used by this university.

Henry VIII, like many men of his time, was afflicted with syphilis, and according to a Cambridge, Massachusetts anthropologist, Grace W. Vicary, the exaggerated codpeices contained medication for the relief from the symptoms. They enclosed a specialized bandage and protected outer clothing from being stained by the medicine. (10) Considering the widespread occurrence of venereal diseases during the Renaissance, the greatly enlarged codpiece as a huge protective device is not too far-fetched. A second possible explanation for the growing proportions of the codpiece is particular to Henry VIII himself.

These include the receptors for insulin and for another hormone called IGF-1, and a protein of increasing interest called TOR ("target of rapamycin"). Rapamycin is an antimicrobial that was recently found to extend lifespan significantly, even when given to mice at an advanced age. Since TOR is involved in the response to caloric restriction, rapamycin may extend life through this pathway.

agreements to devote more resources to the Office of Internal Oversight Services; agreements to spend billions more on achieving the Millennium Development Goals; the dissolution of the Trusteeship Council, because of the completion of its mission; and, the agreement that individual states, with the assistance of the international community, have the " responsibility to protect " populations from, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity-with the understanding that the international community is prepared to act " collectively " in a " timely and decisive manner " to protect vulnerable civilians should a state " manifestly fail" in fulfilling its responsibility. 74

Unfortunately, the abortion issue has allowed many Christians-- and conservatives as a whole-- to claim to be working to defend the most vulnerable when in fact they are turning attention and national resources away from those who are most desperately in need. The good that actually could be done to protect life isn't done because pro-life Christians lend their support to politicians who are most likely to block funding for programs for children and families of the weakest and most impoverished. The abortion issue ends up serving as a smokescreen behind which certain politicians work in the interests of those who are the most rich and powerful.

Bats are known carriers of many viruses and the forest dwelling pangolin could have picked up the virus from bats' droppings on the forest floor, some speculate.

In fact, much of the series revolves around Ma's increasingly strange and sometimes desperate attempts to earn enough cash, including becoming a public wailer at funerals (which ends when he mistakes the address and winds up at a wedding instead), a willing target dummy for an aspiring boxer and his eccentric family, and acting as a slightly dim intellectual to entertain a retired official who thinks that nobody in the culture ministry thinks well of him anymore.

When my grandmother was young, her body was very slim. Now in her old age she's grown plump.
Goals of this program included stirring up riots and possibly poltical assassination. Published FBI papers included this gem: "It should also be a goal of the Counterintelligence Program to pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them before they exercise their potential for violence." This was one reason the program was found to be illegal and contrary to the Constitution by a Senate committee headed by Frank Church.

As will be pointed out in detail in subsequent portions of this report, I disagree with the conclusion of MG Ryder's Team in one critical aspect, that being its conclusion that the 800th MP Brigade had not been asked to change its facility procedures to set the conditions for MI interviews. While clearly the 800th MP Brigade and its commanders were not tasked to set conditions for detainees for subsequent MI interrogations, it is obvious from a review of comprehensive CID interviews of suspects and witnesses that this was done at lower levels.

In Mumbai, Taj Hotel, Colaba and Taj Lands End, Bandra were opened for doctors and other health workers. But for corporates and political leaders, sanitation workers hardly ever count as frontline workers.

Let's face it, our leaders SUCK in this country-- Republicans and Democrats.

First off recently factcheck failed when they stated that Warren was wrong in stating that Brown is a supporter of abortion rights simply because he stated it and made some pro-choice votes. The problem is that it fails miserbly to mention his support of the blunt amendment and other votes that were decidingly against abortion rights.
Some states have adopted laws counting any sexual act committed on a female while she is intoxicated as rape regardless of whether she gives consent. While the law is specifically gender neutral, the only instances that it has been applied in (to my knowledge) involves cases of date rape against women, not date rape against men or boys.

There's no difference. Terminating a pregnancy is murder. I'm sorry the mother might have been raped, just as I hate it that some people have cancer and heart attacks and strokes.
Over 42 years as a public school educator, I'm been deeply frustrated by the way that some districts decided to exclude many inner city kids by creating magnets that suburban students could enter (via admission test) but that most inner city kids could not gain access to. This is one of the reasons that many African Americans have turned to charters, which usually are open to all kinds of students.

Her initial fear of commitment transforms into an ability to recognize and find love, even if it's short-lived.

State immigration laws. Several states have recently passed laws that forbid what the government deems "harboring" of undocumented immigrants-- and what the Church deems Christian charity and pastoral care to those immigrants. Perhaps the most egregious of these is in Alabama, where the Catholic bishops, in cooperation with the Episcopal and Methodist bishops of Alabama, filed suit against the law:

The lack of outrage or concern over the institutionalization of a "kill list " for drone operations, with policies that include dystopian-sounding mechanisms like a " disposition matrix," has largely been due to the belief in the individual judgment of Obama.

That said, Perry is clearly more in tune with the mood of the GOP base, as evidenced when the audience burst into spontaneous applause in response to Brian Williams's bringing up Texas's first-in-the-nation rank when it comes to capital punishment.
